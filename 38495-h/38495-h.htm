<h2>PREFACE,<br />
<br />
By the <span class="smcap">Translator</span>.</h2>

<p>The Author of these <i>Memoirs</i>, who is a Person of an honourable Family in
<i>Prussia</i>, and confess'd by all that know him to be a Gentleman of
extraordinary Talents, is one that may be truly said to have seen the
World; he having not only travell'd twice thro' the principal Parts of
<i>Europe</i>, but by his Acquaintance with People of the first Rank, and a
diligent Inquiry and nice Inspection into Men and Things, attained to that
Knowledge of Both, which is of such Service and Entertainment to Mankind
in the general, and so particularly necessary for All who attend to what
is doing in high Life.</p>

<p>He has succeeded very happily in the right Narrative Stile; and the
<i>French</i> Language, in which he wrote the following Letters, seems to be as
natural to him as if it was his Mother-Tongue. But the Thing which has
most contributed to the Demand for these Memoirs, is the Multitude of
Characters that the Baron has interspers'd, not only of the Deceas'd, but
even<!--007.png--><span class="pagenum">vi</span>
of Persons that are still living, and distinguish'd by the exalted
Spheres in which they move.</p>

<p>That every one of those Characters is equally just, or that every
Circumstance relating to them is told with the utmost Exactness, is not to
be imagin'd: For supposing the Author to have been ever so circumspect and
impartial, how was it possible for him to take the true Likeness of every
one, in such a Variety of Personages of both Sexes, and to be perfectly
sure of every Particular that he mentions; since he could not be
Eye-Witness of every thing, and must be oblig'd for many to Information
from other Persons, of whom, 'tis no wonder if some were prejudic'd? But
to do the Baron Justice, it must be allow'd, that he no where fails in
that Respect and Decorum to Princes which are their due; and that he has
not discover'd a predominant Passion for Satire: because where he has
painted in the strongest Colours, and represented his Subjects in the most
disadvantageous Light, they were such whose Follies or whose Vices were
too flagrant and notorious to be either conceal'd or disguis'd: And,
considering the Groupe of Courtiers whom he has crouded into his Canvass,
the Reader will rather be surpris'd to meet with so few Imperfections in
his Characters, and so many excellent Qualities. By this means, his
Memoirs have, upon the whole, done Honour to his Understanding, without
offending his Conscience, or hurting his
Fortune;<!--008.png--><span class="pagenum">vii</span>
he being, at this very
time, upon a handsome Establishment at the Court of <i>Prussia</i>.</p>

<p>It cannot possibly escape the Observation of the Reader, that the Baron,
when he wrote these Letters to his noble Friend, was a profess'd Member of
the Church of <i>Rome</i>; but that nevertheless, he was not such a Bigot to
its Constitution, nor such a Believer in the Legends of its Writers, or
the pretended Miracles of its Saints, as to incur the Character of a blind
and furious Zealot; it appearing on the contrary, from several
Declarations of his Mind in the following Pages, that he did not want
Charity either in his Nature or Principles for those from whom he differ'd
in religious Sentiments. Such a Catholic Spirit, assisted by his good
Sense, made it, no doubt, much easier for him, after reflecting upon the
Fopperies and Impostures which he had seen in that Church during his
Travels, to abjure the <i>Romish</i> and to embrace the <i>Protestant</i> Religion,
which he did accordingly with great Devotion last Summer, at <i>Berlin</i>;
after which, his <i>Prussian</i> Majesty was pleas'd to distinguish him with
peculiar Marks of his Favour and Esteem, by declaring him one of the
Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, and Chief Cup-Bearer of his Court; and he
has very lately given him a considerable Prebend.</p>

<p>To the new Edition of his Memoirs, from which the following Sheets are
translated, there's not only a great number of material Additions in the
Body of the Work, as is observ'd by the
Editor<!--009.png--><span class="pagenum">viii</span>
of it, <i>Amsterdam</i>, but
several new Notes: In this Translation, these Notes are likewise
considerably augmented, for the sake of continuing the Thread of the
History to the present Time, by the Notice taken of certain remarkable
Alterations, or other curious Particulars that have happen'd to the
Persons or the Places mentioned, since 1734, when the said Edition was
publish'd.</p>

<p>One great Defect for which the foreign Editor has been very much blam'd,
was the want of a Table to these Memoirs; which, if not absolutely
necessary in a Work of this kind, wherein so many Persons and Facts are
mentioned, cannot be necessary for any Book whatsoever that comes from the
Press. To supply this Defect, the Translator has added an Alphabetical
Index to each of the two Volumes; which Indexes are the more copious, that
the Reader might know where to turn in an Instant for some Account of the
Characters, Conduct, or Familys of those public Personages, whose Names so
often occur in the News-Papers.</p>

<h2>THE<br />
<br />
AUTHOR's PREFACE<br />
<br />
TO THE<br />
<br />
FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p><i>There are very few Books without a <span class="f">Preface</span>; and that there are so, is in
a great measure owing to the Fancy of the <span class="f">Booksellers</span>, who think them to
be absolutely necessary, and too often judge of the merit of a Copy by the
Flights of its Preface, and the insinuating Tone of the <span class="f">Author's</span> Voice in
reading it. I had the misfortune to fall into the hands of one of these
Booksellers, so fond of Prefaces, whom nothing would serve but he must
have one at the Head of my <span class="f">Memoirs</span>. My telling him that I did not know
what to put into a Preface, signify'd no more than if I had been talking
to a Post; for he threaten'd to get a Preface compos'd by an Author who
wrote for Wages. This startled me, and I trembled for the fate of my Book,
not doubting that a Preface written by a Man of Letters, who made it his
profession to compose such marvellous Pieces, would altogether eclipse the
few Excellencies in this Work of mine. What, said I to myself, the Sale of
my Book then must depend only on the Goodness of the Preface, which, when
the Readers compare with the Book it self, they will say, O! what a
wonderful Man is the Author of the <span class="f">Preface</span>! What a pitiful Writer, the
Compiler of the <span class="f">Memoirs</span>! No, said I again to my self, I am resolv'd that
the Preface and the Book shall run the same risk; and
since</i><!--011.png--><span class="pagenum">x</span>
<i>Chance has
enter'd me an Author, I'll play out the whole part of one.</i></p>

<p><i>I am told, that the Design of a Preface is to give the Publick an
account, in the first place, of the Reasons that have engag'd the Author
to compose his Work; that then he is to inform the Publick, that 'tis in
meer Complaisance to his Friends, and because there are mangled Copies of
his Manuscript abroad, that he has been determined to put it to the Press;
and finally, that he is to conclude with a sort of Petition, wherein he is
to beg the Reader's Indulgence for his Productions. This, I have been
assured, is the Plan of a Preface; let us now see how well I can execute
it.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the first Article, <span class="f">viz.</span> what Motives I had to write, I sincerely
own that when I set Pen to Paper, I meant nothing more than to amuse
myself. I was the farthest in the World from thinking that I should one
day be overtaken with the Temptation of setting up for an Author. I wrote
Letters to a Friend of mine, purely to divert him with an Account of such
things as came in my way; the Minutes of which Letters I preserved till I
had insensibly formed a Volume of 'em; and having nothing else to do, I
augmented and digested them in the manner that I now give them to the
Publick. The truth is, that my Friends have not used the least Importunity
with me to commit my Manuscript to the Press, nor was it possible for any
spurious Copies of it to get abroad, because no body ever saw it till I
put it into the hands of the Bookseller.</i></p>

<p><i>But I shall be ask'd, what possess'd me to commence Author, and how came
I to be so idle as to put my Name at the Head of a sorry book? I must
answer again, that it was downright Indolence. As to my Name, it would
have been very difficult to have concealed it from Persons to whom I have
the greatest Obligations. I should have been suspected to have been the
Author of these Memoirs at certain Courts, for which I have a Respect both
by Inclination and Duty; and
perhaps,</i><!--012.png--><span class="pagenum">xi</span>
<i>if I had left this Copy to the
wide World, as some do those Foundlings which they are asham'd to own,
such Passages might have been foisted into it, as would have been father'd
upon me, in spite of all Protestations of my Innocence.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the Book itself, I am apt to think there is nothing in it that any
Person whatsoever ought to take offence at. When I speak of Sovereign
Princes, 'tis with the Reverence due to the <span class="f">Lord's Anointed</span>; and I also
endeavour to honour them in their Ministers, being taught by my Religion
that I ought to honour God in his Saints. I have done my utmost to paint
the true Characters of People in Place, and can safely say, that my
Authorities are not meer hear-says or scraps out of News-Papers; for,
thank to God, my Birth and Fortune have put me in a capacity to see, hear,
and judge for myself.</i></p>

<p><i>It will be thought perhaps, that when I speak of Nations in general, I
judge too rashly. It may be so; this being an Article especially in which
all Men do not think alike. The <span class="f">French</span> have a quite different Idea of the
<span class="f">Germans</span> from what the <span class="f">English</span> have, and the <span class="f">English</span> do not pass the same
Verdict on the <span class="f">French</span> as the <span class="f">Swedes</span> do. 'Tis the same in private Life.
Every one makes his own Condition the Standard of his Judgment. The Man of
Quality, the Citizen, the Soldier, the Merchant, have all different Ideas.
The Traveller judges of the Nation where he is, by the Company he keeps. A
<span class="f">Frenchman</span> who in <span class="f">Germany</span> converses with none but those of the second
Class, will say that the <span class="f">Germans</span> are honest People, but clownish; whereas
another, who keeps company with Persons of Quality, or those in Offices,
will agree, that the <span class="f">Germans</span> are more polite than they have been painted
by certain <span class="f">French</span> Writers, who have been transplanted to <span class="f">Germany</span> either by
their Distresses, or by meer Chance. So, a <span class="f">German</span>, who, when he is at
<span class="f">Paris</span>, sees no better Company than the Marchionesses of
the</i><!--013.png--><span class="pagenum">xii</span>
<i>Suburb of
<span class="f">St. Germain</span>, imagines that all the Women both at Court and in the City are
like them. In fine, a Foreigner who takes up his Residence in the City of
<span class="f">London</span>, will entertain a different Idea of the <span class="f">English</span> from what another
shall do who lodges at <span class="f">St. James</span>'s end of the town. They are, as one may
say, so many different Nations in one and the same State, which stand in
little relation to one another; and sometimes attribute Virtues and Vices
to each other without due Consideration. A Foreigner therefore can form a
solid Judgment of none but those with whom he is conversant; and if he has
the good luck to pitch his Tent well, he entertains an advantageous
Opinion of the Nation in general. Let Foreigners, when they return home,
after having kept such various sorts of Company, sit down to draw the
Characters of the Nations they have seen, I do but think what a strange
difference would appear in their Descriptions! The Judgment therefore
which I make of People, is founded upon the Company I kept, and upon what
I heard from such Inhabitants of the Country as appear'd to me to be
altogether unprejudiced, and were pleased to honour me with their
Information. I do not say but, after all, I may have been mistaken; for I
do not pretend to have painted things in any other light than as they
appear'd to me. If, nevertheless, any particular Person thinks himself
particularly intended when I speak of the Inhabitants of any Province or
Town in general, I beg him to remember, that I confess in my Memoirs there
are worthy People in all parts of the World, and 'tis not my fault if his
Conscience does not permit him to rank himself in that number.</i></p>

<p><i>No doubt I shall be reproach'd for relating too many Trifles, and passing
too lightly over things of greater Importance. To speak freely again, I
will make no difficulty to own, that, if when I began these Memoirs, I had
ever thought of printing them, the desire of promoting their Sale might
perhaps have put upon
inserting<!--014.png--><span class="pagenum">xiii</span>
a great many Nothings which I omitted, as
not thinking it worth while to charge my Memory with 'em. The far greatest
part of what the World reads is Trifles, and a History will make its
fortune not by the instructive Facts that are in it, but by the Romantic
Turn the Author gives it. Besides, I am not so vain as to write with a
design of Instructing; for what could I relate in my Travels which others
have not done before me in better Terms? To talk of Learned Men, to make a
Catalogue of Books and MSS. that are to be met with in Libraries, to
ransack the Cabinet of the Curious, to publish Inscriptions, to treat of
antique Medals, to affirm that I have seen an <span class="f">Otho</span> of Brass, which is
known to be but of Silver, what a Posse of Men of Learning would rise up
against me! Whereas, now I fear nothing; the Learned don't read Trifles,
or if they do, they scorn to criticise them. I shall to them remain
unknown, or at least, my Meanness will be my Protection against their
Indignation.</i></p>

<p><i>I would fain be as secure against the Criticism of those, who reading for
the sake of their amusement, require an exact, elegant Stile in trifles,
that is, adorn'd with the Flowers and Garlands of Rhetorick. But how shall
I gain their Indulgence? If I own to them that I could do no better, they
will say to me, and justly enough, <span class="f">Alas! then what made you write?</span> To
which I shall answer, as I said before, that it was meerly for want of
something else to do. If they will but forgive me this time, I assure them
that I not only will never relapse into the same error, but that I shall
not be sorry if they disdain to take Notice of my Book: And if the reading
of these Memoirs inclines them to sleep, I shall think my self very well
rewarded for having contributed to their Repose.</i></p>

<p><i>After all, I am more particularly obliged to ask pardon of the <span class="f">French</span>
than any other Nation: 'Tis in their Language I have presumed to write,
and they are my proper Judges. Such is their Politeness and their</i>
<!--015.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span><i>Readiness
to assist Foreigners, that I doubt not of Mercy. And in
return, I promise them, that if a <span class="f">Frenchman</span> ever vouchsafes to write in
the <span class="f">German</span> Language, I will forgive him any Errors that he may commit.</i></p>

<p>N. B. "These Memoirs went off so quick, that before they had been out
scarce six Months, the <i>French</i> Bookseller was oblig'd to prepare for this
<i>Second Edition</i>; to which, there are considerable Additions both in the
Body of the Work and in the Notes, of curious and interesting Facts and
Characters, and the principal Alterations that have happen'd at the
several Courts, since the first Edition.</p>

<p>"There is added in particular, a very circumstantial Account of the
present Elector of <i>Saxony</i>'s Family, his Ministers, and Officers; and in
short, of the Chief Persons of both Sexes belonging to his Court and
Houshold. This is prefix'd in the Original, at the Head of the Memoirs;
but the Translator thought it more regular as well as more consistent with
the Method observ'd every where else by the Author, to place it at the End
of his Description of the City of <i>Dresden</i>. The Baron has dedicated that
Account to the present Elector (<i>Augustus</i>, King of <i>Poland</i>) and
introduc'd it with the following Preface."</p>

<h2>PREFACE,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">To the Second Edition</span>.</h2>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Present State of the Court of Saxony</span><i>, which is added to this
Edition, has no need of a Preface to recommend it, the very Title shewing
that 'tis what concerns every <span class="f">Saxon</span> especially to be acquainted with.</i></p>

<p><i>All Subjects have a desire to know something of their Sovereign; and
private Men in every State have this Curiosity, with respect to their
Ministers and Courtiers. These are the Characters which I have ventured to
draw, tho' I own, that I don't think I have always hit the Life, for want
of that Penetration and Delicacy of Imagination which Nature, to me a
Step-Mother, has deny'd me; and also because it would have been necessary
for me to have stay'd longer than I did at <span class="f">Dresden</span>. Three Months Residence
at so great a Court, are hardly sufficient to make a Man acquainted with
it, were his Fund of Knowledge even as deep as mine is shallow. Then what
a Presumption would it be for me to think I have attained to it!</i></p>

<p><i>I must not dissemble, that this Book with all its Imperfections, has cost
me more trouble in composing than one much larger would have done upon a
Subject that had been more familiar to me. There was a necessity for me to
make Inquiry into many Particulars, and to get some of my Information from
a private hand. I own my Obligation to the Civility of M. <span class="f">Konig</span>, the
Counsellor of the Court, for the Intelligence I
wanted</i><!--017.png--><span class="pagenum">xvi</span>
<i>relating to some
of the Court-Nobility. If I had been so happy as to have found out but one
or two Persons more as active for me as he was, my Work would have been
more correct and more extensive. Such as it is, I intreat the Reader to
accept it, and to forgive any Errors in it, in consideration that I am the
first who has ventured to treat of such a Subject. I own, there is a
certain degree of Rashness in the Undertaking, but the noble Motive that
has induc'd me to it, seems to plead for my excuse.</i></p>

<p><i>All <span class="f">Saxony</span> knows in general, that 'tis govern'd by a Sovereign, gracious,
and vigilant to render it happy. It were needless to set the King's
Virtues and Actions before their Eyes, which the People already admire,
and pray for him. But as this Great Prince does not want those who envy
his Glory, they are the Persons whom I have chose to make asham'd of
themselves; and have endeavoured, if possible, to reclaim others whom a
fatal blindness keeps at a distance from his Majesty's Person<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</i></p>

<p><i>All that ever had the honour of approaching <span class="f">Augustus III.</span> will agree with
me that he adorns that Throne, upon which a respectful Nation has plac'd
him; and that whatever I have said of this Monarch is short of what might
be mention'd. How is it possible to give the true Portraiture of a King
born without Vice, by Principle virtuous, and religiously good? To admire
him in silence is the only way to please him, which I know too well, not
to conform to it; and therefore I have not presum'd to expatiate so far in
his Praise as the Sublimity of the Subject demands.</i></p>

<p><i>The same Aversion of the Queen to Praise, has confin'd me within the same
bounds. How many Virtues have not I been forc'd to smother? What Thoughts</i>
<!--018.png--><span class="pagenum">xvii</span><i>have
not I sacrific'd, lest I should offend the noble Modesty of that
August Princess, who with a Simplicity attending her Grandeur, makes her
Glory to consist in being humble in the midst of Honours?</i></p>

<p><i>I believe no body will dispute the Truth of what I have advanc'd relating
to the</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Royal</span><i> and </i><span class="smcap">Electoral</span><i>, the</i> <span class="smcap">Princes his Brothers</span><i>, and the
</i><span class="smcap">Princesses his Sisters</span><i>. The hopes I have raised of what may be expected
from</i> <span class="smcap">their Royal Highnesses</span><i>, will surely be confirm'd by Time, and by
all those who have access to them.</i></p>

<p><i>The Actions of the Duke <span class="f">John-Adolphus</span> of <span class="f">Saxe-Weissenfels</span> are so well
establish'd that I have not thought fit to anticipate History, by which
they are to be consecrated: And for the same reason, I have but just
touch'd upon the amiable Qualities of his Mind, which are rever'd both by
the Court and the Army.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the Princess of <span class="f">Saxe-Weissenfels</span>, I frankly own, that as I had not
the honour of paying my Court to her, what I have said of her Virtues has
no other Authority than the Voice of the Publick, which can never speak
enough in her Praise.</i></p>

<p><i>I have been more copious in treating of the Ministers; and what I have
said of them is so true, that they who know them not may thereby form a
just Idea of what they are.</i></p>

<p><i>I have taken as much notice of the principal Lords and the most
distinguish'd Ladies of the Court, as the little time I had for this Work,
and the Limits to which I was confin'd, would permit. I flatter myself
they will forgive the Freedom with which I use them; and hope I have
preserv'd a Decency in my Language which will secure me from Reproach.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER I.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Berlin, June 6, 1729.</i></span>

</div>

<p>From <i>Breslaw</i> to <i>Berlin</i> 'tis 40 <i>German</i> Miles of very even Country,
well peopled and cultivated. There are I know not how many little Towns in
the Road, not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The first Place of any Importance is <span class="smcap">Crossen</span>. This City is the Capital of
the Dutchy from whence it has its Name, which formerly made a Part of
<i>Silesia</i>, but is now annex'd to the Electorate of <i>Brandenburgh</i>. There's
a Bridge at <i>Crossen</i>, by which we pass the River <i>Oder</i>, defended by
Fortifications. The Town is situate in a pleasant fruitful Country. The
Houses, which are all of Brick, are uniform, and the Streets as strait as
a Line. The chief of
them<!--027.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
terminate in a great Square in the middle of
the Town, where there is a Statue of the King of <i>Prussia</i>. The River
<i>Oder</i> is of great advantage to the Commerce of <i>Crossen</i>, which carries
on a considerable Trade in Linnen-Cloth and Earthen Ware.</p>

<p>Going out of <i>Crossen</i>, we pass this River by a Bridge, as we do a second
time over to <span class="smcap">Francfort</span>, a considerable City of the Marquisate of
<i>Brandenbourg</i>, famous for its Fairs, and its University. This City has
stood the Shock of various Revolutions. It was put under the Ban of the
Empire by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> IV. for having disobey'd his Orders; and
the Inhabitants to make him easy were forc'd to pay him down 12000 Marks
of Silver, which at that time was an immense Sum. In 1631 the <i>Swedes</i>
besieg'd and took it by Storm, when they put all the Inhabitants to the
Sword in reprisal for the Massacre of 2000 <i>Swedes</i>, whom the Emperor's
General Count <i>Tilly</i> had inhumanly put to death in the City of
<i>Brandenbourg</i>. By the Peace of <i>Munster</i>, or <i>Westphalia</i>, which
establish'd the Tranquility of the Empire, <i>Francfort</i> was restor'd to the
Elector of <i>Brandenbourg</i> its lawful Sovereign.</p>

<p>Here is a University founded by <i>Joachim</i> I. (Margrave of <i>Brandenbourg</i>)
in 1506, which is very much frequented by the <i>Silesians</i>, and by the
<i>Hungarian</i> Protestants.</p>

<p>There are two Fairs a Year at <i>Francfort</i>, which render it a trading City,
and its Commerce consists in Linnen-Cloth, and Fells.</p>

<p>'Tis ten Miles from <i>Francfort</i> to <i>Berlin</i>, and a flat sandy Country. The
Road leads thro' <i>Munchenbourg</i>, a little Town chiefly inhabited by the
Descendants of <i>French</i> Men, who left their Country upon the Revocation of
the Edict of <i>Nantes</i>.</p>

<p>The nearer one comes to the Capital of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, the more sandy is
the Soil, yet the Country produces plenty of Corn and Fruits.</p>

<!--028.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span> is the common Residence of the King of <i>Prussia</i>, and one of the
largest, best built, and best govern'd Cities in all <i>Germany</i>. The
Streets are spacious, strait, neat and well pav'd. The Situation is
advantageous; for tho' it lies in a very sandy Soil, yet it is encompass'd
with agreeable Gardens producing Fruits and excellent Pulse, and its
Commerce is much improv'd by the River <i>Spree</i>; which passes thro' the
City, and has a Communication with the <i>Havel</i>, the <i>Oder</i>, and the
<i>Elbe</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i>, who for the sake of Religion became Refugees, have
contributed in an extraordinary manner to the Establishment and
Aggrandisement of <i>Berlin</i>, by the establishing of all sorts of
Manufactures, and the introducing of Arts into it; and it may be said of
them, that they have omitted nothing to testify their Gratitude to the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i> and his Posterity, for the generous Reception
which he gave them in his Dominions.</p>

<p><i>Berlin</i> is divided into five Wards exclusive of the Suburbs, which are
very extensive. I will run thro' these Wards in the Order of their
Situation: But before I do this, I propose to shew you what is most
remarkable in the Suburbs; where the Houses are generally of Timber, but
so well plaister'd that they seem to be of Stone; and the Streets are
broad, lightsome and strait.</p>

<p>In the Suburb of <i>Spandau</i> the Queen has a delightful House and Gardens.
The House is called <i>Monbijou</i>; a very proper Name for it, because 'tis
really a Jewel. 'Tis a Pavilion, the Apartments of which are laid out with
Art, and furnish'd with great Judgment and Elegance. The Gardens are
charming, and lie finely open to the River. This House was built by the
Countess <i>de Wartemberg</i>, Wife to the Prime Minister of King <i>Frederic</i> I.
As her Husband's Power and Favour were at that time so great, that he did
whatever he pleas'd, all
the<!--029.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
King's Workmen and Architects us'd the
utmost Diligence to serve her well. But she did not enjoy this fine House
long; for it was scarce compleated when the King removed the Count from
all his Employments, and banish'd him to <i>Francfort</i> on the <i>Maine</i>.
However, he settled a Pension upon him and his Lady of 24000 Crowns, and
the Countess by way of Acknowledgement gave the King this House, which of
all the immense Treasure that she had amass'd, was the only Piece that she
cou'd not carry with her. The King gave this House to the Princess Royal
now Queen, who has added great Embellishments to it, and brought it to its
present State of Perfection.</p>

<p>In the Suburbs of <i>Stralau</i> is the House and Gardens of <i>Belvedere</i>,
belonging to the King. <i>Rollé</i> Superintendant of the Finances to the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, caus'd this Garden to be made, in which he
laid out considerable Sums; and as this Minister was at other very great
Expences, it so impair'd his Fortune, that he was oblig'd to throw up all
and retir'd to <i>Holland</i>; and being very much in debt to the Elector, his
Garden was forfeited to that Prince, who made a Present of it to M. <i>de
Fuchs</i>, one of his Ministers. King <i>Frederic</i> I. purchas'd it of the
latter, and after having embellished it, made a Present of it to the Queen
his third Wife; but that Princess's ill state of Health obliging her to
retire to <i>Mecklenbourg</i> her Native Country, <i>Belvedere</i> became neglected.</p>

<p>Near this Royal House is the magnificent Gardens of <i>Craut</i>, who from a
Boy behind the Counter rais'd himself by his Industry to the Post of
Pay-master General of the Army, and at length to that of Minister of
State. He was to have been call'd to account in his last stage of Life,
but he cunningly diverted that Storm by feigning himself Lunatic; and
dying, he left an immense Estate, part of
which<!--030.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
fell to the King by way
of Restitution, and the rest to his Nephew, who makes a grand Figure at
<i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>I enter'd <i>Berlin</i> thro' that call'd the Gate <i>Royale</i>, which has had that
Name ever since the Day that <i>Frederic</i> I. made his Entry there, after his
Coronation at <i>Koningsberg</i> in <i>Prussia</i>. This Gate is defended by a
Half-Moon, and two Bastions fac'd with Brick, and fronts that call'd the
Street <i>Royale</i>; one of the longest and most frequented in all the City.
There are very fine Houses in it, particularly that of M. <i>de Catsch</i>, a
Minister of State, that of <i>Grumkau</i>, and the Post-House, which last
Building was begun by order of the late King, for his Favourite the Count
<i>de Wartemberg</i>, who was hereditary Post-Master.</p>

<p>Thro' the Street <i>Royale</i> there run fine, spacious and beautiful Streets.
The first is call'd <i>la Rue du Cloitre</i>, in which we see the Royal
Manufactory. <i>Frederic</i> I. who bought it of the Heirs of the Marshal <i>de
Flemming</i>, established an Academy of Nobles there; so that, on the Payment
of three hundred Crowns, they had Lodging, Provision, and Instruction in
every thing that it's natural a Man of Quality shou'd know. This
Establishment existed a few Years, but sunk at last meerly thro' the
Neglect of Persons whose Business 'twas to take care of it. The present
King has chang'd this Fabrick into a Work-house, and allowed Lodgings in
it for several Woollen Manufacturers.</p>

<p>Adjoining to the Royal Manufactory, there are public Warehouses, which
were established and built by the late King; and being destroyed by Fire,
the present King caus'd them to be rebuilt. Opposite to the Warehouses
stands the House of M. <i>de Creutz</i>, Minister of State; which has fine
Apartments, and is very neatly furnish'd. Higher in the same Street
there's the House of M.
<i>Duvaine</i>,<!--031.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
a <i>French</i> Man by Birth, and
Lieutenant-General of his <i>Prussian</i> Majesty's Forces: And contiguous to
his House, which makes a fine Appearance, is the <i>Calvinists</i> new Church,
a Structure rais'd after the Model of <i>Grunberg</i>, an Architect who had
before acquir'd a Reputation, which did not suffer by his Contrivance of
this great Fabrick: The Front of it is magnificent, but the inside plain,
as are all the Churches of the <i>Calvinists</i>, which you know don't admit of
Images. The subterranean Places or Catacombs, for interring those that
worship here, are worth seeing. Several Persons have been interr'd there
of great Note, particularly <i>Casimir de Colbe</i>, Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>,
Prime Minister, Great Chamberlain, Master of the Horse,
Post-Master-General, Protector of all the Academies in the Dominions of
the King of <i>Prussia</i>, and Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle. Being
banish'd in 1711, to <i>Francfort</i> upon the <i>Maine</i>, where he died the Year
following, he ordered that his Corpse shou'd be carry'd to <i>Berlin</i>; and
his Will was accordingly fulfill'd. He was so dear to King <i>Frederic</i> I.
that he was very loth to part with him; but was, as it were, compell'd to
it by a Cabal, who oppos'd his Ministerial Authority; tho' he was provok'd
at the Insolence of <i>Wartemberg</i>'s Wife, and at his mean Submission to
her. The King made an Offer to him afterwards, by the Count <i>Christophle
de Dohna</i>, (who was then his Ambassador at <i>Francfort</i>, for the Election
of the Emperor,) to come and resume his Employments, on condition that he
wou'd not bring his Wife with him; but <i>Wartemberg</i> refus'd, saying, he
was engag'd in honour not to forsake her. Perhaps he was very glad of this
Excuse for not returning, because he had once experienc'd the Vicissitude
of Fortune, and knew well that he had been too powerful a Man not to be
hated. King <i>Frederic</i> I. who was
desirous<!--032.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to see his Funeral pass by,
cou'd not refrain Tears; which undoubtedly was the greatest Character that
he cou'd give of his Minister.</p>

<p>Next to the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>'s Tomb, is that of <i>Henrietta de
Pollnitz</i>, Wife to <i>Francis</i> Count <i>de Duhamel</i>, the <i>Venetians</i>
Generalissimo. Her Husband dying in the <i>Morea</i>, this Lady return'd to
<i>Venice</i>, proposing to go and end her Days at <i>Berlin</i>, where she was
born; but while she was performing her Quarantain she died, after desiring
her Body to be carry'd to <i>Berlin</i>; which was accordingly done by two of
her Nephews, and one of her Nieces, whom she made her Heirs. There is also
the Tomb of the Count <i>de Denhoff</i>, Lieutenant-General of the King's
Armies, Knight of his Order of the Black Eagle, Minister of State,
Governour of <i>Memel</i>, and Ambassador at the Treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>, where he
acquired a high Reputation among the foreign Ministers. The Marshal <i>de
Villars</i>, who had known him at <i>Vienna</i>, when he the Marshal resided there
in the quality of Minister, to take care of the Affairs of <i>France</i>, said
to me one day, speaking of the Count <i>de Denhoff</i>, that the King of
<i>Prussia</i> cou'd not do enough to reward the Count's great Merit. <i>If he
wou'd have been rul'd by me</i>, added he, <i>he wou'd have been in the Service
of the King my Master</i>.</p>

<p>The second Street that crosses the Street <i>Royale</i>, is the <i>Jews</i> Street,
which runs into the Square <i>Molcke-Marck</i>; where the Hotel <i>de Schwerin</i>
makes a fine Appearance. Within a few Houses lower down, there's a
Manufactory of Gold and Silver Lace, which one <i>Schindler</i> has established
with good success: This House belong'd to the Wife of M. <i>de Wensen</i>,
Marshal of the Court to King <i>Frederic</i> I. but she resign'd it as part of
Payment of a Fine, to which her Husband had been condemn'd by the Count
<i>de Wartemberg</i>, then prime
Minister;<!--033.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
who confin'd M. <i>Wensen</i> in
<i>Custrin</i> Castle, because he had presum'd to represent to the King that
the Table of the prime Minister, which was served by his Majesty's Cooks
and Butlers, was more expensive than his Majesty's own Table. <i>Wensen</i>
however, upon the Payment of this Fine, obtain'd his Liberty, and was
banish'd to his Lands in the Dutchy of <i>Zell</i>.</p>

<p>In the middle of <i>Molcke-Marck</i> is the Statue of <i>Frederic</i> I. Father to
the present King, with a Crown on his Head, and a royal Mantle on his
Shoulders. The Statue was cast by order of <i>Frederic</i> I. himself, who
intended to have it plac'd in the Court of the Arsenal; but dying before
it cou'd be brought about, the King his Son caus'd it to be set up where
it now stands, which is indeed a much better Place for it.</p>

<p>The <i>Spandau</i> Street, which is the third that crosses the Street <i>Royale</i>,
contains the Town-House, and other fine Buildings: The Street <i>St. Esprit</i>
is altogether as beautiful, as is the Kay, which fronts the Castle or
Palace of the King. Upon this Kay we see the House of the Baron <i>de
Vernesobre</i>, whose Ancestors being <i>French</i> Protestant Merchants, settled
at <i>Koningsberg</i> in <i>Prussia</i>. He was in <i>France</i> at the time of the
<i>Mississippy</i> Plague, which, tho' so fatal to others, prov'd so fortunate
to him, that he gain'd several Millions of Livres, with which he came and
set up at <i>Berlin</i>, where he has taken to building, having purchas'd the
Estate of <i>Hohensihn</i> from Monsieur <i>de Borstel</i>, one of the best
Gentlemen of the Country, procur'd himself the Title of Counsellor of
State, and cuts a Figure now among Persons of Quality.</p>

<p>The Churches of St. <i>Mary</i>, St. <i>Nicholas</i>, and that belonging to the
Garrison, are as magnificent as any of the Protestant Churches. St.
<i>Mary</i>'s has a beautiful Spire. When <i>Frederic</i> I. made his royal Entry
here, at his return from his Coronation, a Man ascended to the Globe of
this Spire, and
saluted<!--034.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the new King by flourishing a pair of Colours.
The Church of the Garrison was founded by the late King, but was very much
damag'd some Years ago by the blowing up of a Magazine of Gun-Powder in
the Neighbourhood, just as they were removing it to a safer Place. King
<i>Frederic William</i> has caus'd it to be rebuilt with more Magnificence than
before. The Organs are very fine, and the Galleries very well contriv'd.</p>

<p>That Ward of <i>Berlin</i> which I have now run through, is separated from that
of <i>Coln</i> or <i>Cologne</i> by the River <i>Spree</i>, over which there are four
Bridges, whereof there is one of Stone, call'd the <i>Pont-neuf</i>. <i>Frederic</i>
I. in imitation of the <i>Pont-neuf</i> at <i>Paris</i>, famous for the Statue of
<i>Henry</i> IV. caused the Equestrian Statue of his Father, the Elector
<i>Frederic-William</i>, to be erected upon this Bridge, with very great Pomp
and Splendor; for no Prince in <i>Germany</i> strove more than he did to copy
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. in Magnificence and every thing else. When this Statue was
dedicated, the Count <i>de Lottum</i>, who was then Grand Marshal of the Court,
accompanied by most of the Courtiers on horseback, and by the City
Companies, assisted at the Ceremony, which was performed with an
<i>Apparatus</i>, till then unknown in <i>Germany</i> upon the like Occasions; but
had been practised at <i>Paris</i>, when the Statue of <i>Lewis le Grand</i> was
erected in that City.</p>

<p>This entire Monument was design'd by one <i>Jacobi</i>, who after several Years
Labour and constant Application to it, has brought it to its present
State. This skilful Operator has represented the Elector in a <i>Roman</i>
Dress, and in an heroic Stature; that is to say, above the natural Size.
The Statue is placed on a magnificent Pedestal of white Marble. At the
four Corners of the Base, are placed as many Slaves in Brass, who seem as
if they were chain'd to it.</p>

<!--035.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>When one has pass'd the Bridge, the King's Palace offers itself to view; a
great and stately Fabric, which <i>Frederic</i> I. began in the Year 1699, and
a worthy Monument of that Prince's Magnificence, who was of Opinion, that
of all the Sums expended by Sovereigns, those which they lay out in
Buildings are least liable to Censure. And indeed Magnificence is well
bestowed, and even Profusion seems justifiable in Architecture, because
grand Edifices are the principal Ornament of any State.</p>

<p>The Palace has been the Workmanship of several Architects; the Name of the
first was <i>Schluter</i>, but he not giving Satisfaction was dismiss'd, and
went into the Service of the Czar <i>Peter Alexiowitz</i>. Whatever he did is
extremely incumber'd with Ornaments which have not a due Proportion. His
Successor was <i>Eosander</i>, a <i>Swede</i>, who is a Lieutenant-General in the
Service of the King of <i>Poland</i>: He was oblig'd in some measure to pursue
what <i>Schluter</i> had begun; so that if he has not come off well every
where, he has at least that for his Excuse. The third was <i>Bot</i>, a
<i>Frenchman</i>, and now General Officer in <i>Poland</i>; who without dispute was
a much better Artist than the others. Every thing that he has done is more
simple, yet more grand, noble, and complete.</p>

<p>These three Architects having gone upon different Plans, you will easily
imagine that the Fronts are not perfectly regular; yet for all this, had
the Palace been finish'd according to the Models approv'd of by the late
King, it wou'd have been inferior to no Edifice for Grandeur and
Magnificence, except the <i>Louvre</i> of <i>Paris</i>. King <i>Frederic-William</i> does
not think fit to carry on this Building, but leaves that Honour to his
Son, the Prince Royal.</p>

<p>As to giving you all the Particulars of this vast Palace, you will be so
good as to excuse me:
Be<!--036.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
satisfied if I only tell you, that it consists
of four Stories: The Apartments are large, have fine Cielings, and are
royally furnish'd. In no part of the World did I ever see such a
prodigious quantity of Plate, Tables, Stands, Lustres, Chandeliers,
Screens, Looking-Glass Frames, Couches, Arm-Chairs, all of Silver. The
late King left Plate to the value of two Millions eight hundred thousand
Crowns, not reckoning the Fashion. In that call'd the Knights Hall,
there's a Beaufet which takes up one intire side of the Room, where there
are Cisterns and Basons Silver gilt, of an extraordinary Size.</p>

<p>The Furniture of the grand Apartment is very rich; there's a fine Gallery
adorn'd with Pictures, the Cieling of which was painted by one <i>Peine</i>, a
<i>Frenchman</i>, who in divers Compartments has skilfully represented the
principal Actions of King <i>Frederic</i> I. At the End of this Gallery there's
a Saloon, which was formerly magnificent to the last degree, being
wainscotted, if I may so call it, with Amber: But the late Czar coming on
<i>Berlin</i> in his return from <i>Holland</i> and <i>France</i>, and not a little
admiring this Furniture, which was the only thing of its kind, the King
made him a Present of it: so that what had been amass'd with great Care
and Cost by several Electors, fell in one Day into the hands of a Nation,
which, no longer ago than the beginning of the present Century, was
reckon'd Barbarian.</p>

<p>The Palace had fine Gardens belonging to it before they were destroy'd,
and converted into a Place of Arms, and a Parade for the Guards.</p>

<p>Hard by the Palace are the King's Stables, a very grand Building, facing
the great Street. The Architecture without is <i>Gothic</i>, but the inside is
more magnificent; the Stables are broad and
spacious,<!--037.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
very lofty, and
very lightsome: the Mangers are of Stone, and the Pillars which mark the
Stands for the Horses, are of Iron, and adorn'd with the King's Cypher,
gilt: Over the Mangers are several great Pictures of the finest Horses
that ever came out of his Majesty's Studs. The Backside of the Stables
projects towards the River <i>Spree</i>, to which they can lead the Horses by a
Stair-Case without Steps, built in the form of a Horse-Shoe.</p>

<p>The Main Body of the House contains grand Lodgings for the Master of the
Horse, and the Officers under him. Over the Stables are great Rooms where
they keep a deal of fine Furniture, both for the Horse and Mule;
magnificent Sleds, with convenient Harness, adorn'd with Bells of Silver,
or Silver gilt; a great number of fine Arms; the rich Accoutrements of the
Horse which serv'd <i>Frederic</i> I. on the Day of his public Entry; all the
Ornaments of the Bridle, the Breast-Leather, and Crupper, as well as the
Bits and Stirrups, being of Gold adorn'd with Brilliants.</p>

<p>Over the Riding-House is the great Theatre, where, in the late King's
time, Interludes and Comedies us'd to be acted before the whole Court; but
the Opera of <i>Roxana</i> and <i>Alexander</i> was the last that was acted on it.
It was play'd in 1708, upon the Marriage of King <i>Frederic</i> I. with
<i>Sophia</i> of <i>Mecklemberg</i>. In 1706, an Interlude was acted there, on
account of the Arrival of the Princess Royal, now Queen; intitled, <i>Beauty
triumphing over Heroes</i>; at which the Markgraves <i>Frederic-Albert</i> and
<i>Christian-Lewis</i>, the late King's Brothers, danc'd, with all the young
Courtiers.</p>

<p>As we go farther down the great Street, we come to the Fish-Market, where
is the Hotel of the City of <i>Cologne</i>, and <i>Dorffling</i>'s Hotel occupied by
the Count <i>de Finck</i>. This Family is oblig'd for its Rise to the Marshal
<i>Dorffling</i>, who from an
Apprentice<!--038.png--><span class="pagenum">13</span>
to a Taylor rais'd himself by his
Valour and Merit to the highest Posts in the Army. The Story goes, that
when he had serv'd his Apprenticeship at <i>Tangermunde</i>, having a mind to
go to <i>Berlin</i>, he came to a part of the Country where he cou'd not
proceed without crossing the <i>Elbe</i>, but not having wherewithal to pay his
Passage, the Ferry-Men refus'd to carry him over; which so vex'd him, that
he threw his Knapsack into the River in a Pet, curs'd the Trade of a
Taylor, and went back to <i>Tangermunde</i>, where he listed himself a Soldier.
There being a War at that time all over <i>Germany</i>, it was no difficult
matter for the young Warrior to find an Opportunity to shew his Courage;
and he signaliz'd it in such a manner, that his Officers, who were all in
love with him, strove to advance him, and therefore made him known to the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>. This Prince who lov'd, rewarded, and was a
good Judge of Valour, did not depend upon what Fame reported of him; but
in order to see his Officers and Soldiers fight with his own Eyes,
conducted them himself to the Enemy, and very soon took notice of
<i>Dorffling</i>. He saw him at every part of the Field where there was Honour
to be won: He saw he was a sensible industrious Fellow, that he hated
Parties and Cabals, and that he had that <i>Germanic</i> Probity which was the
distinguish'd Virtue of our Forefathers, but which we now content
ourselves with admiring. The Elector observing such a Stock of Virtue in
<i>Dorffling</i>, thought him deserving of his Favour, advanc'd him to the
tip-top Employments, and made him very rich. Envy, which is as old as the
World itself, and which like that, never stands still, made several of the
Courtiers jealous of the Fortune or rather the Merit of <i>Dorffling</i>, and
there were some who did not stick to say, that if the Marshal came to be
ever so great a Nobleman, he wou'd always retain the Air of a Taylor. This
<!--039.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>being
carry'd to <i>Dorffling</i>, <i>True enough</i>, said he, <i>I was a Taylor,
and I have cut out Cloth; but now</i>, said he, clapping his Hand to the Hilt
of his Sword, <i>I have an Instrument in my Hand, with which I'll cut off
the Ears of any Man that slanders me</i>.</p>

<p>This brave Fellow liv'd to a great Age, and left a Son who was one of the
King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Lieutenant-Generals, and Colonel of a Regiment of
Dragoons, but died without Issue. He had not quite the Vivacity of his
Father, but he had his Honour and Integrity.</p>

<p>Going out of the Fish-market, as we turn to the right, one perceives the
<i>Lutheran</i> Church of <i>St. Peter</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, which is a considerable Structure;
and then we come into that call'd the <i>Fryars</i> Street, the Houses of which
are all well built. In this Street stands the Palace where the <i>Aulic</i>
Council meets, which in <i>France</i> they call the <i>Parlement</i>; 'tis here that
all Civil Causes are try'd, and from thence there lies an Appeal to the
King's Council.</p>

<p>Beyond the Palace there is a Square, on the Right side of which there's a
Church with a Cupola which belongs to the <i>Calvinists</i>, and is look'd upon
as the Cathedral of <i>Berlin</i>: For you know that the late King made two
Bishops, one in <i>Prussia</i> and the other at <i>Berlin</i>, and they were the
Prelates that crown'd him. They are since dead, and the present King lets
their Sees lie vacant. In this Church is the Tomb of the Royal Family.
There's a great Row of Buildings over against it, which consists of
several uniform Houses belonging to
Merchants,<!--040.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
and supported by stately
Arches with Shops under them, where are sold all sorts of Goods. Turning
round by that Piazza, brings one to a second Branch of the River, which
divides the Ward of <i>Coln</i> from that of <i>Werder</i>. This River, which has
three wooden Bridges over it, is confin'd in a Canal lin'd with Freestone,
and form'd by two fine Kays.</p>

<p>The most considerable Edifices in the Ward of <i>Werder</i> are the Royal
Custom-House, so commodiously situate that Boats can come up close to it:
The <i>French</i> School, and their Church, which is serv'd by able Ministers;
some of whom, as the late M. <i>Lenfant</i> (Author of the celebrated <i>History</i>
of the <i>Council of Constance</i>, &amp;c. and Chaplain to the King of <i>Prussia</i>)
M. <i>de Beausobre</i> and M. <i>Jacquelot</i>, &amp;c. have acquir'd a Reputation in
the Republic of Letters. The Royal Hunting-House is a large magnificent
Structure for lodging the great Huntsman and all his inferior Officers:
There too is the great Dog-Kennel and the Magazines for all the Hunting
Equipage. Near this place is the Hotel or Palace for Ambassadors, where
are likewise entertain'd such Foreign Princes as are not of a Rank high
enough to be accommodated in the King's Palace. This Hotel belong'd
formerly to the Baron <i>de Danckelman</i>, Prime Minister to King <i>Frederic</i>
when he was only Elector, and being built by the said Minister at a time
when he was such a Favourite that he did almost what he pleas'd, he spar'd
no Cost to render it a Mansion worthy of his high Station. I was assur'd
by Persons of Credit then alive, that after it was built, the late King
had a Desire to see it, upon which occasion M. <i>de Danckelman</i> made a
great Entertainment for him; and that while the Queen and the whole Court
were dancing, the King retir'd into his Minister's Closet, to have a
private Conference with him; and looking very earnestly on a certain
Picture<!--041.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
there, M. <i>de Danckelman</i> told him, that Picture and all that he
saw would soon be his Majesty's. The King not knowing what he meant,
desir'd his Minister to explain himself; whereupon he made answer, 'That
he shou'd very shortly incur his Displeasure; that his Fall wou'd be
attended by the Forfeiture of all his Estate; that he should be arrested
and committed to the <i>Spandau</i> Prison; and that there he should be
confin'd ten Years, at the Expiration of which his Innocence wou'd be made
to appear, his Estate wou'd be restor'd to him, and he shou'd be taken
again into his Majesty's Favour.' The King, who was at that time very fond
of his Minister, and did not think he cou'd ever do without him, ridicul'd
what he had said as the Surmise of a Visionary, and was going to swear by
the New Testament then upon a Table in the Room, that this sad Prophecy
wou'd never come to pass. But the Minister held his Hand, and begg'd him
not to take an Oath which it wou'd not be in his power to keep.</p>

<p>I tell you this Story just as I had it from a Lady of Quality to whom the
King himself told it: But in short, let the Story be as it will, 'tis very
certain that M. <i>de Danckelman</i> was disgrac'd, committed Prisoner to
<i>Spandau</i>, and from thence remov'd to <i>Peitz</i>, without any Companion but
his Wife, who generously desir'd to suffer Imprisonment with him. His
Confinement lasted much longer than he had prophesy'd, and when at length
he obtained his Release, he was not restor'd to his Employments, nor even
to his Estate. 'Tis said indeed that the present King, who on his
Accession to the Crown sent for M. <i>de Danckelman</i> to <i>Berlin</i>, offer'd
him the Ministry; but that the Baron excus'd himself by reason of his
great Age and his tedious Imprisonment, which had made him lose the
Connection of Public Affairs. This Minister
died<!--042.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
lately, having lived to
the Age of fourscore. His remarkable Disgrace, and fifteen Years
Confinement in a Prison, had not sunk his Spirits, nor shock'd his
Constancy of Mind; and one shall scarce meet with an Instance in History,
either before or since, of more Merit and more Misfortune in one and the
same Person. He was a passionate Admirer of Learned Men, and a Rewarder of
Virtue. In a word, by the Disgrace of this Great Man, the State lost a
faithful disinterested Minister, and Men of Learning lost a <i>Mecænas</i>,
full of Zeal and solid Knowledge, who never fail'd to support by his own
Authority, and to procure a Reward from his Master, for all Persons that
apply'd to him with any Proposal that was useful and uncommon.</p>

<p>To go from the Ambassadors Hotel to the New Town, one must pass before the
House belonging to the Governour of <i>Berlin</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, who is at present the
Marshal Count <i>de Wartensleben</i>; a Nobleman whose Virtues, long Services,
and great Age, challenge Veneration. The House he lives in was built by
order of the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, for the Reception of the Marshal
<i>de Schomberg</i>, who resign'd the Battoon of the Marshal of <i>France</i> to
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. after that Prince had revok'd the Edict of <i>Nantes</i>, and came
with a numerous Retinue of Gentlemen, to desire Employment under the
Elector. Accordingly that Prince gave him the Command of his Troops, but
the Marshal quitted that Employment, to accompany the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> to
<i>England</i>, in his famous Expedition against his Father-in-Law; and he
likewise attended that Prince to <i>Ireland</i>, where he acquir'd great Glory,
but was kill'd in passing the River <i>Boyne</i>.</p>

<!--043.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Governour's House</i> is separated by a great Square from the <i>Arsenal</i>,
which is one of the compleatest Fabrics in <i>Europe</i>, and was built
according to a Model design'd by <i>Bot</i>, whom I mention'd to you before;
which skilful Architect has, upon this occasion, equalled any thing that
was ever done by the famous <i>Bernin</i>.</p>

<p>The intire Structure consists of four main Bodies of Building, which form
a spacious Quadrangle in the middle. The lower Story is of Rustic
Architecture, with arch'd Windows. There are three great Porticoes at the
Entrance to each Front. Over the principal Gate there's the Picture of the
late King, in a great Medal of Brass. The four Cardinal Virtues of a
Gigantic Size, are plac'd on Pedestals by the Portico, and seem to look
towards the King's Effigies, which is supported by Fame and Victory. The
<i>Corinthian</i> Order prevails throughout the first Story, and is very
artfully executed. A Gallery or Ballustrade runs round the whole Edifice,
and is adorn'd with Trophies and Statues, particularly a very perfect one
of <i>Mars</i>, sitting upon a Heap of Arms of different sorts; and the
Decoration of all together is noble and majestic. Studs of Iron in form of
Cannon are plac'd at proper Distances, and support Iron Chains, hung in
Festoons, which hinder People from clambering up to the Windows.</p>

<p>The Inside of this <i>Arsenal</i> is as magnificent as the Outside. The lower
Rooms are stor'd with a great number of Brass Cannon. The Walls and
Pillars that support the Arch are garnish'd with Cuirasses and Helmets. In
the upper Story there are several Rooms full of Arms, rang'd in such Order
as can never be enough admir'd.</p>

<p>Behind the <i>Arsenal</i> there's the House of the General of the Ordnance,
which also contains the Foundery, where Men are continually at work.</p>

<p>Besides this <i>Arsenal</i>, there are several others in <i>Berlin</i>, where they
keep Field-Pieces, Iron
Cannon,<!--044.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
and all that belongs to the Train of
Artillery. 'Twas the late Margrave <i>Philip</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, Brother to <i>Frederic</i> I.
who when he was Great Master of the Ordnance began to put the King's
<i>Arsenals</i> into a good State. But King <i>Frederic-William</i> has finish'd
what his said Uncle began, and has put the Artillery on such a footing,
that 'tis a question if any <i>Arsenal</i> in <i>Europe</i> is on a better
Regulation.</p>

<p>A Rampart and a Ditch separate the <i>Werder</i> from the <i>Dorothy-Stadt</i>, or
new Town, which is for most part inhabited by <i>French</i> Families. It had
the Name of <i>Dorothy-Stadt</i> in honour of the Electress <i>Dorothy</i> of
<i>Holstein-Glucksburg</i>, the second Wife of <i>Frederic-William</i>, who with her
own Hand planted the first Lime-Tree of the seven great Rows which divide
this Ward into two Parts. The middlemost Row, which is the widest, is
inclos'd with Ballustrades, and forms a pleasant Grass-Walk for
Foot-Passengers. The Walks on each side are pav'd, and serve as a Ring for
the Coaches. Nothing is more beneficial and agreeable than taking the Air
in this Place, where you may have any thing that can be desir'd in a City.
At the end of one of these Walks is a Gate which opens to the Park, the
Walks of which being above a League in length, form a fine Point of View.</p>

<p>On both sides the Lime-Tree Rows, are Houses, among which the Palace of
Madame the Margravine, Dowager<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to the Margrave <i>Philip</i>, Brother to the
late King, is one of the best. The late
Margrave<!--045.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
purchas'd this Palace
(which at that time was inconsiderable) of the Wife of <i>Weiller</i> Colonel
of the Artillery, who had thrown up his Employments, Wife, Children and
all, to go with a Lady of Quality, that was in love with him, to <i>Vienna</i>.
This Gentlewoman pass'd for a modern <i>Sappho</i>, and every body talk'd of
her Virtue and good Sense. But being a Slave to the Follies of Love, and
asham'd to let them be seen at <i>Berlin</i>, where she was counted an Oracle,
she resolv'd to quit the Place of her Birth, and engag'd her Lover to
leave all and follow her.</p>

<p>The Margrave made considerable Augmentations to this House, and render'd
it very commodious. The Furniture of the Palace also is rich, and worthy
of the Princess who resides in it.</p>

<p>Opposite to the Margravine's Palace is a Building which was formerly
call'd the King's Little Stables, but has been metamorphos'd into Caserns
for the Gendarmery; they discover the Magnificence of <i>Frederic</i> I. who
caused them to be built. The Apartments that run over the Stables are
occupied by the Academy of Painters, and that of Arts and Sciences. Behind
the Stables there's the Observatory, with a great number of Astronomical
and Mathematical Instruments, of which there are many of a new Invention.</p>

<p><i>Frederic-Stadt</i>, which is the fifth Ward of <i>Berlin</i>, communicates with
the New Town and the <i>Werder</i>. This is one of the pleasantest Wards in the
whole City, the Streets being spacious, strait, and planted with
Lime-Trees<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<!--046.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps I have dwelt too long upon the Metropolis of the Electorate of
<i>Brandenburgh</i>; but I thought that as there had been no true Account yet
given of this City, you wou'd not be sorry to have it from me.</p>

<p>The next day after my Arrival here, I had the Honour to see the King, who
was then seeing his Soldiers mount guard. He is a Prince of a middling
Stature, and in very good Plight of Body: His Air commands Respect; yet,
when he pleases, no Prince in the World can be more gracious. I heard him
speak to his Officers in such a kind manner as cou'd not but charm them; I
admir'd his Genius for military Discipline, and perceiv'd that with the
Glance of an Eye he cou'd discover the least Fault committed against that
wonderful Exactness which is introduc'd in the Evolutions of his Troops.
After the Guards had perform'd their Exercise, the King stay'd to see them
file off. I never yet saw Troops march with more Order and State, so that
it seem'd as if they were all mov'd by one Spring. All the Soldiers are
young, of an even Stature, and the cleverest Fellows that Nature ever
form'd: they are well cloth'd, and have such an Air of Neatness, that even
the private Centinels might all pass for Officers. I remember you was
prejudic'd against their Clothing; their Clothes you said were too strait,
and too short. I was of your Opinion once, and think so still, when I
happen to see one of their Officers and Soldiers singly among us, who wear
Night-Gowns rather than Coats; but when I see a whole Body of <i>Prussians</i>
together, I am of another Opinion, and think their Dress gives them a
warlike Air which other Troops have not. You will tell me perhaps, that
the Clothing of the <i>Prussians</i> is good in a Garrison, but that in the
Field their Garments
are<!--047.png--><span class="pagenum">22</span>
not wide enough to cover the Soldiers in the
Night. I answer, that the <i>Prussian</i> Soldiers are in no danger of not
being cover'd, because when they are in the Field, every Captain is to
carry as many Coverlids, as there are Comrades in his Company. But you'll
say, this must be a very great Incumbrance, and take up a deal of
Equipage. 'Tis true, it may require two Sumpter Horses in a Company, but a
Soldier fares the better for it; because when he goes wet into the Camp,
he can get his Clothes dry'd in the Night while he is under his Coverlid.
After all, the Incumbrance is no greater at present, for those Troops,
than it was at the time when all the <i>Prussian</i> Infantry had Cloaks, which
the Soldiers wore, was the Weather ever so hot, folded over their
Shoulders, and ty'd both before and behind by their Belt. If they had any
hasty March to make, such as I saw they made in <i>Flanders</i> in 1708, when
they went to attack the <i>French</i> near <i>Audenarde</i>, the <i>Prussians</i> left
their Cloaks behind with a Guard, and when the Battle was join'd, the
Captains were oblig'd to send for their Cloaks. In short, what makes me
think the <i>Prussian</i> Clothing the most convenient for a Soldier, is, that
most of the <i>German</i> Princes are now come into it, and like it well: The
Troops of <i>Saxony</i>, and <i>Brunswic</i> in particular, are cloth'd like those
of <i>Prussia</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Prussian</i> Troops, which are new cloth'd every Year, have Breeches of
Woollen Cloth for the Winter, and of Linnen for the Summer; and they are
allow'd Shirts, Necks and Spatterdashes: Their Pay is good and regular;
the Soldier is compell'd to do his Duty, but when he does it, enjoys more
Liberty than in the Service of any other Nation: so that were I to carry a
Musket, I fancy it wou'd be in the Service of <i>Prussia</i>, where such a
strict Discipline is observ'd, that the Soldier is no Swearer, and is not
allow'd to game, and where in a word he does
not<!--048.png--><span class="pagenum">23</span>
abandon himself to
Licentiousness. On Sundays and Saints Days they are requir'd to go twice a
day to hear a Sermon: The Catholicks have the liberty of going to Mass. In
short, good Manners are introduc'd and observ'd in those Troops to such a
Nicety, that you would wonder at it.</p>

<p>All the Infantry is cloth'd in blue. It depends on the Colonel of every
Regiment, to order what Waistcoats and Trimming he pleases for the
Clothes. The Horse and Dragoons wear white, but the Houshold Troops blue,
with Campaign Coats of Gold Lace. The Hussars Clothing is red, but the
Garbs of the Officers both of Foot and Horse are plain, and only differ
from the Apparel of the Soldiers in the fineness of the Cloth; tho' there
are some Regiments whose Waistcoats are bedaub'd all over with Gold or
Silver Lace.</p>

<p>The Colours, which are uniform in all the Regiments, are white, with the
King's Device, representing an Eagle flying towards the Sun with this
Motto, <i>Nec Soli cedit</i>. There's such a Uniformity preserv'd in all things
throughout the Army, even in their Guns, Swords, Bayonets, &amp;c. that in
every Regiment they wear the very same, even to their Shoe-Buckles.</p>

<p>The same Regularity is observ'd in the Horse and Dragoons, which ride both
upon black Horses; and indeed they are not permitted to have any others,
the Officers themselves being not exempt from this Rule, when they are at
the head of their Squadrons or Companies. The Housings and Equipage of the
latter are of the same Pattern, and extremely rich. All the Horse wear
Buff-Coats, and underneath Cuirasses. They perform their Exercise on Foot
like the Infantry, and with the same Exactness. The Kettle-Drums and
Trumpets of all the Horse are of Silver.</p>

<p>There is not a Captain in all the <i>Prussian</i> Army but has at least ten
supernumerary Men;
so<!--049.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
that these included, the King's Forces amount to
near 100000, all pick'd Men. You cou'd not but admire if you were to see
how they behave; insomuch that whenever they take the Field, 'tis pity but
Fortune shou'd favour them.</p>

<p>Not many Days after my Arrival here, the King being gone to visit his
Kingdom, I had the Honour of waiting on the Queen. This Princess, whose
Name is <i>Sophia-Dorothea</i>, is Sister to the present King of <i>Great
Britain</i>, being the Daughter of <i>George</i> I. the late King, and of
<i>Sophia-Dorothea</i> Princess of <i>Brunswic-Zell</i>. And she does every thing
that is worthy of her August Extraction; for surely never did Daughter
more resemble a Father; she has the same Benignity and Wisdom, the same
Equity and Justice, and Sweetness of Temper. Like him she knows the Charms
of a private Life, and Friendship, on a Throne: Like him she is ador'd by
her Subjects and her Domestics, and is the chief Blessing and Darling of
both. To extend Goodness and Affability farther, were impossible; there
being no Foreigners but what are charm'd with the gracious Manner in which
this Princess receives them. To a thousand Virtues worthy of Veneration,
she has added the singular Talent of speaking the Language of several
Countries which she never saw, with as much Delicacy as if they had been
her Mother Tongues. The <i>French</i> Language especially, is so familiar to
her, that one wou'd take her to be a Princess of the Royal Family of
<i>France</i>; and the Grandeur and Majesty that accompany all her Actions,
induce those even who don't know her, to be of Opinion that she was born
to reign.</p>

<p>That which still more endears this Queen to her People, is the Care she
takes of the Education of her Family; which consists of four Princes, and
six Princesses. The eldest of the Sons is stil'd
the<!--050.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
<i>Prince Royal</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
This young Prince is handsome, charms every one by his Kindness and
Good-Nature; and loves Reading, Musick, the Arts, and Magnificence: His
Sentiments, his Behaviour, and his Actions, make it probable, that if he
comes to the Crown, his Reign will be one of those mild and peaceable
Reigns, which procure Kings that Love of their People, wherein consists
their true Glory. The Care of the Prince Royal's Education was committed
first of all to Madam <i>de Camke</i>, one of the Queen's Ladies of Honour, and
Governess of the Children of <i>Prussia</i>. But this Lady left the Charge of
the latter to the Sub-Governess, Madam <i>de Rocoule</i>, and her Daughter
Madamoiselle <i>de Montbail</i>. Madam <i>de Rocoule</i> had also the honour to be
Sub-Governess to the King; so that she was no Novice in the forming of
young Princes. As she talks nothing but <i>French</i>, she has taught it to the
King's Children; who speak it with as much ease as they do the <i>German</i>
Language. At seven Years of Age the Prince Royal was taken out of the
Hands of the Women; and the Count <i>de Finck</i> of <i>Finckenstein</i>,
Lieutenant-General of the King's Forces, a Knight of his Order, and
Colonel of a Regiment of Horse, was appointed his Royal Highness's
Governour; and the Baron <i>de Kalestein</i> was made Sub-Governour. The King's
Choice of both these Gentlemen was universally applauded.</p>

<p>The eldest of the King's Children is <i>Frederica-Sophia-Wilhelmina</i>, the
Princess Royal; who was born in 1709. I was at <i>Berlin</i> at the Ceremony of
her Baptism, which was performed in the Chapel of the Castle, in presence
of <i>Frederic</i> IV. King
of<!--051.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
<i>Denmark</i>, <i>Frederic-Augustus</i> King of
<i>Poland</i>, and <i>Frederic</i> I. King of <i>Prussia</i>. The Birth of this Princess,
and the Circumstances of three Kings and a Queen attending at her Baptism,
gave occasion to a great many Copies of Verses. All the Poets said that
the Presence of these three Kings, was a Sign that she wou'd one day have
Possession of three Crowns. They had then in view the Crowns of <i>Great
Britain</i>, that were to devolve to the Family of <i>Hanover</i>; in which there
was a young Prince<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, who, it was then imagin'd, was to be in time the
Husband of this Princess. Whether this Match will ever take place, and
whether the Princess will be Queen, I can't say; but if she is not,
Fortune will not do Justice to her Merit.</p>

<p>The Princess <i>Frederica-Louisa</i>, the King's second Daughter, is lately
married to the Margrave of <i>Brandenburgh Anspach</i>. 'Tis said that his
Majesty's third Daughter, the Princess <i>Philippina-Charlotte</i>, is promised
to<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><i>Charles</i>, hereditary Prince of <i>Brunswic-Bevern</i>, Nephew to the
Empress Regent.</p>

<p>The other Princes and Princesses, the King's Children<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, are as yet too
young to furnish any Particulars for their Character. In a word, put them
all together, they form a very fine Family.</p>

<p>The Margravine, Dowager of the
Margrave<!--052.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<i>Philip</i>, Brother to the late
King, is the first in Rank at Court, next to the King's Children: She was
born Princess of <i>Anhalt-Dessau</i>. Her Royal Highness was lately chose
Abbess of <i>Herford</i>, a sovereign Abby in <i>Westphalia</i>, (in a Town
belonging to the King of <i>Prussia</i>, as part of the Principality of
<i>Ravensberg</i>;) whose Canonesses must be all Princesses, or Countesses of
the Empire. This Princess, tho' she is past her Bloom, is still the
Ornament of the Court; and no Person can be more civil than she is to
Foreigners; so that 'tis as much a Pleasure as a Duty to pay one's Court
to her. When the King is at <i>Berlin</i>, and the Queen has no Drawing-Room,
the whole Court repairs to the Margravine's House, where her Royal
Highness daily keeps an elegant Table; to which she admits the Quality of
both Sexes. She is the Mother of two Princes and a Princess; the Sons are
the Margraves <i>Frederic</i> and <i>Henry</i>, and the Daughter is married to the
hereditary Prince of <i>Wirtemberg</i>. The young Margrave <i>Frederic</i> resides
at <i>Schwedt</i> upon the <i>Oder</i>, where he has a very fine House; but does not
come to Court but when he can't avoid it. The young Margrave <i>Henry</i>
resides commonly at <i>Berlin</i>. Both these Princes are handsome, lusty, and
well shap'd.</p>

<p>The Margrave <i>Albert</i>, the King's Uncle<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, lives in his Majesty's
Palace, tho' he is eight Months of the Year at <i>Frederichsfelde</i>, a
Pleasure-House about a League from <i>Berlin</i>. He is the second Son of the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, and <i>Dorothy</i> of
<i>Holstein</i><!--053.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<i>Glucksburg</i>: He
is well shap'd, has a noble Air, and has been in his time a very good
Dancer: He is fond of Grandeur and Pleasures. At the beginning of the last
War he distinguished himself very much at the Siege of <i>Keyserswaert</i>, and
other Places, where he commanded the Troops of the King his Brother. His
Royal Highness is Governor of <i>Pomerania</i>, Knight of the Black Eagle, and
Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and of another of Horse, in the King's
Service: He has also a Regiment of Foot in the Service of the <i>United
Provinces</i>; and is Grand Master of the six Commanderies of the Order of
St. <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, who, at the Alteration of Religion in the time
of <i>Luther</i>, withdrew from the Grand Master of <i>Malta</i>, and assum'd to
themselves a Right of chusing a Grand Master under the Protection of the
Elector of <i>Brandenburgh</i>. The Margrave marry'd a Princess of <i>Courland</i>,
Heiress to the Freeholds of her Uncle Duke <i>Ferdinand</i>, the last of her
Family. This Princess, tho' not reckon'd a Beauty of the first Rate, has a
great Share of Charms and Good-nature, Modesty and Politeness. Their Royal
Highnesses are perfectly civil to those who have Access to them; which is
the reason, that notwithstanding the little Concern they have in Business,
they have always a numerous Court. They have three Princes, and two
Princesses. The eldest of the Sons is <i>Charles</i>, a Prince whose Person and
Character are very amiable. The eldest of the Daughters is married to the
Duke of <i>Saxe-Eysenach</i>.</p>

<p>The last Prince of the Royal Family, is the Margrave <i>Christian-Lewis</i>,
third Son of the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i> by the second Marriage. This
Prince is Governour of the City and County of <i>Halberstadt</i>; he has a
Regiment of Foot, is Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle, and Commander
of that of St. <i>John</i>. He studied at <i>Leyden</i>; after which,
he<!--054.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
serv'd
with distinction in <i>Italy</i>. He now lives retir'd from Court at <i>Malchau</i>,
a House about a Mile from <i>Berlin</i>, which the late King bought of the
Heirs of M. <i>de Fuchs</i>, his Minister of State. There the Margrave, who has
a Relish for the Pleasures of private Life, passes his Time in Hunting,
Reading, and every innocent Pleasure that an agreeable Country is capable
of furnishing. This Prince has been a handsome well-made Man; he has a
grand Air, and there's something heroic in his Physiognomy: In the very
Flower of his Youth he was a constant Admirer of Virtue, and might ever be
quoted for an Example of Sobriety. He is so exceeding fat, that it's
fear'd he won't live to be a very old Man<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>All the Princes of the Royal Family wear the <i>Prussian</i> Order, <i>viz.</i> that
of the Black Eagle; and receive it as soon as they are born. 'Tis an
Orange Ribband, to which is appendant a Cross enamel'd with blue,
resembling the Cross of <i>Malta</i>. A Star of Silver is embroider'd on the
Coat; and in the middle of it is an Orange Escutcheon, over which is a
black Eagle crown'd with Wings display'd, holding in one of its Talons a
Crown of Laurel, and in the other a Thunder-bolt, with the Motto, <span class="smcap">Suum
cuique</span>, in Letters of Gold. This Order was instituted by <i>Frederic</i> I. the
sixth of <i>January</i> 1701, <i>O. S.</i> on account of his Coronation at
<i>Koningsberg</i>. He call'd it the Order of the Black Eagle, because a Black
Eagle forms the Arms of <i>Prussia</i>; and he chose an Orange Ribband, in
memory of the Electress his Mother, who was a Princess of <i>Orange</i>; in
Right of whom he pretends to be next Heir to <i>William</i> III. King of
<i>England</i>, and Prince of <i>Orange</i>.</p>

<p>The Princes of the Royal Family are not exempt from passing thro' the
Degrees of military Service; and 'tis not here as in other places, where
they have Regiments and Governments as soon as they are born. The King
will have them to know how to obey, before they come to command; and 'tis
an Encouragement to the Officers to find themselves so far honour'd, as to
be on a Par in the Service, with those who are born to be their
Sovereigns. The Prince Royal has a Regiment of Horse<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. M. <i>de
Lopel</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, a Major-General, commanded that Regiment formerly, but the
King preferring him to the Government of <i>Custrin</i>, this Regiment has for
Colonel M. <i>de Wreech</i>, a Person of a good Family in the new Marquisate.
His Father, who was one of the King's Lieutenant-Generals, had serv'd the
late Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, the late King, and his present Majesty.
M. <i>de Wreech</i>, whom I am speaking of, was, at his return from his
Travels, appointed by the late King a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber: After
that Prince's Death, his present Majesty enter'd him into his Service, and
gave him a Troop of Horse. This Gentleman distinguished himself greatly in
1708, at the Battle of <i>Audenarde</i>; where he was <i>Aid de Camp</i> to the
Marshal <i>de Natzmer</i>, then General of the Cavalry: He had a Horse kill'd
under him, and was taken Prisoner; but the Enemy in their Flight not
watching him very strictly, he found means to get off when the Night came
and put an end to the Battle. He lay hid in a Ditch till next day, in
danger every moment of being knock'd on the head by our own Men; but when
the Day broke, he rejoin'd his General, who had received
a<!--056.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
slight Wound
in the Head. M. <i>de Wreech</i> is one of the richest Subjects the King has;
but he is worthy of his Fortune, and uses it like a Man of Quality. He is
certainly a valuable Gentleman, has a noble Soul, and Sense and Knowledge
enough to capacitate him to serve his King and Country both in Peace and
War.</p>

<p><i>Berlin</i> is not a City where you ought to look for the most lively
Diversions; the King, to whose Will every body conforms, not being fond of
them himself. Yet when once a Man is known there, he will find Amusement
enough; for the People are affable and civil, make plentiful
Entertainments, and have very good Wine.</p>

<p>When the King is absent, the Queen has a Drawing-Room every Night, from
seven o'clock till ten; when her Majesty sups with the Princes and
Princesses of her Family, and other Persons of Distinction of both Sexes.
But when the King is at <i>Berlin</i>, the Queen keeps no Drawing-Room, unless
some Foreign Prince happen to be there. Then there are Assemblies in the
City alternatively, among Persons of the first Rank, at which they
sometimes dance; and the King and Prince Royal frequently honour these
Assemblies with their Presence. When there is no grand Assembly, there are
particular Societies, where they sup, and play at small Game.</p>

<p>The Ministers of most consequence at this Court are Messieurs <i>d'Ilgen</i>,
<i>Grumkau</i>, and <i>Kniphausen</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; these are they who treat of Foreign
Affairs, and thro' whose hands pass the Secrets of State: but the King's
Prime Minister is the King himself, who is inform'd of every thing, and is
desirous to know every thing. He gives great Application to Business, but
does it with extraordinary Ease; and
nothing<!--057.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
escapes his Penetration, nor
his Memory, which is a very happy one. No body knows better than he where
his Government is strong, and where 'tis weak; and no Sovereign in the
World is of more easy Access, his Subjects being actually permitted to
write to him, without any other Formality than superscribing the Letter,
<i>To the King</i>. By writing underneath, <i>To be deliver'd into his Majesty's
own Hands</i>, one may be sure that the King receives and reads it, and that
the next Post he will answer it, either with his own Hand or by his
Secretary: these Answers are short, but peremptory, and they prevent a
tedious painful Attendance. The King, who is an Enemy to vain Pomp and
Pageantry, always goes abroad without any Guards, with only a small
Retinue, and sometimes too walks on foot; he makes his Greatness to
consist in solid Power, in the having his Troops well disciplin'd, his
Places kept up in good Order, his Arsenals well provided, and his Treasury
full enough to enable him to oppose his Enemy in case he be attack'd. He
never aims so much as to disturb his Neighbours, much less to rob them: I
heard him say one day, that <i>he had no Intention of attacking any body,
nor of beginning a War; but if he was attack'd, he would defend himself
the best he could</i>: a Conduct which he has religiously observed ever since
he has been plac'd upon the Throne, even towards <i>Charles</i> XII. King of
<i>Sweden</i>, notwithstanding what is said of him by a certain Author, who
from sorry Memoirs has wrote that Prince's Life. But I will not deviate
from my Subject.</p>

<p>There's no Town in all the King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Dominions, except
<i>Neufchâtel</i>, where he has not been; no Province which he does not know
full well; not a noble Family but he can tell their Revenues; nor a Court
of Justice but he is well acquainted with their chief Members. His
Behaviour is plain;
he<!--058.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
knows no Gallantry, and does not easily pardon it
in his Officers. He is so true to his Consort the Queen, that he wishes
all Men would follow his Example, and that every Husband would live only
with the Woman whom God has allotted him. His Diversion is Hunting; and
for this reason, he resides commonly at <i>Potzdam</i> or <i>Wusterhausen</i>, which
are Pleasure-Houses four Miles from <i>Berlin</i>. Yet he generally goes on
<i>Saturdays</i> into his Capital, where he holds a Council on <i>Sunday</i>, and
returns on <i>Monday</i>. In the Winter he makes a longer stay at <i>Berlin</i>: but
let him be either here or there, he is on the Parade every Day at ten
o'clock, when his Soldiers mount the Guard; after which he gives Audience
to his Ministers, and holds a Council, or goes abroad for the Air. At Noon
the King appears in a great Saloon, where are all the Generals and
Officers, the Foreign Ministers, and all the Court in general: There he
converses a few Moments, and then goes into another Room, where he dines
with the Queen, the Princes and Princesses of his Family, and any other
Persons whom he has caused to be invited. His Table is commonly spread for
eighteen Guests. After he has sate about an Hour and half at Table, he
retires to his Closet till six at Night, when he appears again in the Room
where he held his Levee: There his Majesty gives Orders to the Marshal
<i>Wartensleben</i> Governor of <i>Berlin</i>, and to the Marshal <i>Natzmer</i>
Commandant of the Gendarmery. After this, he talks a while with those that
are present, and then passes into a Room at some distance from his
Apartment, to which the Queen repairs sometimes with one or two Ladies in
company. There are ten or a dozen Officers whom the King honours with his
Confidence, who play here at <i>Picquet</i>, <i>Ombre</i>, and <i>Backgammon</i>. Here
they also smoak, and to this Place the King sends for such as he has a
mind
to<!--059.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
talk with about special Affairs. I have been there twice upon
such an account. Here there is no manner of Restraint, but every body sits
down, the King dispensing with all the Respect that is due to him, and at
eleven o'clock he dismisses the Company and retires.</p>

<p>The King hunts when he is at <i>Potzdam</i> and <i>Wusterhausen</i>; but in other
respects he leads the same Life there as he does at <i>Berlin</i>. At <i>Potzdam</i>
he hunts the Stag, having for that end caused a great Forest to be paled
in, where he has made noble Roads.</p>

<p>The Castle at <i>Potzdam</i>, which is very convenient, was built by the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, who commonly resided at it; and after having
run his glorious Race, died here the 29th of <i>April</i>, 1688. King
<i>Frederic</i> I. made considerable Embellishments to it, particularly the
great Gate opening into the main Court of the Castle, which is an
admirable Piece of Architecture that was design'd by M. <i>Bot</i>, my Hero for
Buildings. But all that the late King did, does not come up to the Works
that have been added to it of late Years. The Town of <i>Potzdam</i> has been
augmented two Thirds; the Streets are as strait as a Line, with Trees
planted, and Canals cut in them after the manner of <i>Holland</i>; the Houses
are uniform and built with Bricks. Besides a great Hospital, which the
King has founded here for his Soldiers' Orphans, here is a considerable
Fabric for Armourers, who make all those Arms for the Forces and Arsenals,
which were formerly made at <i>Liege</i>.</p>

<p>This Town is the Garrison for the first Battalion of those <i>Tall
Grenadiers</i>, so much talk'd of in <i>Europe</i>. I protest to you that they
exceed the common Report, being the compleatest, the finest, and
best-disciplin'd Body that can be imagin'd. The Men are of all Nations,
there being scarce a Prince in <i>Europe</i> but takes a pleasure in sending
Recruits<!--060.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
to it. Some of these Grenadiers have had 1500 Crowns List-Money;
and several receive two Florins <i>per diem</i>: Some of them are very rich;
others there are who trade, and have good Houses at <i>Potzdam</i>. The tallest
and the best Man among them all was one call'd <i>Jonas</i>, (lately dead) who
work'd heretofore in the Mines of <i>Norway</i>. The famous <i>Huguetan</i>, whom
<i>Frederic</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i> created Count <i>de Guldenstein</i>, took him
from the Mines, and presented him to the King. He then stoop'd in the
Shoulders, and hobbled in walking; but by tricking him up, they gave him
that good Air which he wanted.</p>

<p>'Tis certain, there are no Troops in the World where the Peasant sooner
shakes off the clownish Air, and more easily assumes the military one.
This gigantic Regiment has requir'd great Pains, and considerable Sums to
establish it; and I am assured it has cost the King more than six other
Regiments. But 'tis all his Majesty takes delight in; and surely this
Prince cannot but be commended for giving into a Pleasure so noble, and so
innocent.</p>

<p>Having given you some Account of <i>Potzdam</i>, I must also mention
<i>Charlottenbourg</i>, another Royal House, a Mile from <i>Berlin</i>. This Castle
stands on the <i>Spree</i>, so that one may go to it by Water: but the common
Way is thro' the Park which is at the end of the great Walk from the new
Town.</p>

<p>In the late King's time, whenever he was at <i>Charlottenbourg</i>, all the
Road from <i>Berlin</i> to this Palace was lighted by Lanthorns erected on both
sides.</p>

<p><i>Charlottenbourg</i> was formerly call'd <i>Lutzenbourg</i>. It was a small
Village belonging to M. <i>Doberginsky</i>, Steward of the Houshold to the
Queen, (the King's Mother.) He had built a trifling House there, and that
Queen taking the Air there one day, lik'd the Situation of the Place so
well, that she bought it, and set about building there; but she died
before all
the<!--061.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Works she had undertaken were finished. However, her
Husband King <i>Frederic</i> I. caused them to be carried on, and made
considerable Additions to them; and in order to perpetuate the Queen's
Name, which was <i>Sophia-Charlotte</i>, he caused <i>Lutzenbourg</i> to be called
<i>Charlottenbourg</i>. This Castle is one of the most considerable Structures
in <i>Germany</i>; the Apartments are grand and splendid, and the Furniture
very rich. There's a Cabinet adorn'd with the choicest Porcellane, ranged
in such order as is surprising: In another Cabinet there are Lustres, a
Tea-Table with Dishes, a Coffee-Pot, and the whole Equipage in short of
solid Gold. The Chapel is one of the most superb that can be; every side
being adorn'd with Gold and Painting. The Orangery is one of the most
magnificent in <i>Europe</i>; not only with regard to the Beauty and Number of
its Trees, but the Greatness of the Building in which they are kept all
the Winter.</p>

<p>I could tell you of several more Houses which the late King had in the
Neighbourhood of <i>Berlin</i>; but as they were suffer'd to run to ruin after
he died, I think I had better entertain you with the Characters of the
prime Nobility at this Court.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Wartensleben</i> is the oldest Marshal. He is by Birth a
<i>Westphalian</i>, and pass'd his early days in the Service of <i>France</i>. He
was Commander in chief of the Troops of the Duke of <i>Saxe-Gotha</i>, when
King <i>Frederic</i> I. called him to his Service. The Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>,
who was at that time the Chief Minister, wanted a Person to be at the head
of the Troops, who should be intirely devoted to himself: This was an
Obedience he did not expect to find in the Counts <i>de Lottum</i>, <i>Dhona</i>,
and <i>Denhoff</i>, nor in the other Generals whose long Services and Birth
might make them aspire to this military Dignity. He believed the fittest
Person to be his Tool would be a Foreigner that should
be<!--062.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
oblig'd to him
for his Fortune: Therefore he caus'd the Marshal's Batoon to be given to
the Count <i>de Wartensleben</i>, who answer'd to a tittle the Intention of the
Minister his Benefactor. 'Tis true, that he never seconded his Revenge,
but neither did he oppose it. He did the Business of his Office, and
meddled not with the Intrigues of the Court. It may be said of him, that
he never deviated from the Path of Equity, and in Justice to him it must
be own'd that he always did good, when it was in his power. Since the
Death of the late King, his Authority and Interest are very much lessened.
Besides, he is too far advanc'd in years to concern himself with almost
any Business at all.</p>

<p>The General whose Power is most rever'd, is the Prince <i>Leopold</i> of
<i>Anhalt-Dessau</i>. In consideration of his high Birth, and the Rank of
Sovereign which he holds in the Empire, I ought to have nam'd him first;
only the Count <i>de Wartensleben</i> is the oldest Marshal.</p>

<p>The Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> is Marshal, Governour of the City of <i>Magdebourg</i>,
Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle.
This Prince, who is a Person of a good Stature and noble Presence, happy
Features and a lively Aspect, was born with all the Qualifications of a
General and a Soldier, being vigilant, laborious, indefatigable, equally
patient of Heat and Cold, Want and Abundance; Brave even to Intrepidity,
and possibly never equalled in this respect, unless we except <i>Charles</i>
XII. King of <i>Sweden</i>: Being a Man of unexampled Rigour in Military
Discipline, he will be obey'd; but then he rewards his Soldiers when they
do their Duty, and sometimes makes himself familiar with them: A warm and
constant Friend, but an implacable Enemy when he thinks himself not well
us'd; haughty to his Equals, civil and courteous to his Inferiors. In his
Youth, he was a Wine-Bibber, and a
Deboshee;<!--063.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
but it has been observ'd,
that neither Wine nor Women can detain him, when he is in the pursuit of
Glory. He is a religious Observer of his Promises, and never makes any but
after mature Reflection. He is an Enemy to the Pomp and Constraint of the
Lives of Great Men; an &OElig;conomist, perhaps more than becomes his
Dignity; and is an absolute Master in his Family and his Government,
having poor, but dutiful Subjects, and well-regulated Finances.</p>

<p>The Care of the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i>'s Education was committed to M. <i>de
Chalisac</i>, a Native of <i>Guienne</i>. This Gentleman found an ungovernable
Temper in the young Prince which he had much ado to manage. The Prince
happen'd very early to have a liking for Madamoiselle <i>de Fohsen</i>, (whom
he afterwards marry'd) which being not at all pleasing to his Mother, (who
was born Princess of <i>Orange</i>) she thought the best way to cure him of his
Fondness for her, would be to send him abroad; and therefore appointed M.
<i>de Chalisac</i> to travel with him to <i>Italy</i>, and accordingly they made
that Tour.</p>

<p><i>Chalisac</i>, who was my particular Friend, and whose Memory I honour, told
me that this Prince's extraordinary Vivacity and Intemperance, had often
made his Heart ake; but that whenever he happen'd to run astray, he was
sure to reclaim him by setting the Motives of Honour and Ambition in his
View. To this purpose he related what happen'd when they were at <i>Venice</i>,
viz. that the Prince came home one Morning very much in Liquor, after
having spent the whole Night in a Debauch; and M. <i>de Chalisac</i> reproving
him, perhaps a little too sharply, as the young Prince thought, he ran and
snatch'd up a Pistol, and returning with it to his Governour, said, <i>You
Dog, I must kill you</i>. M. <i>de Chalisac</i>, without
appearing<!--064.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
surpriz'd,
looking sternly at the Prince, made him answer; <i>Shoot me if you think
fit; but think how worthy a Figure you'll make in History, when it shall
be recorded that a Prince of <span class="f">Anhalt</span>, a Prince of a Family that has given
Emperors to <span class="f">Germany</span>, murder'd his Tutor</i>. These Words spoke with an Air of
Authority made such an Impression on the young Prince, that he laid down
his Pistol saying, <i>You are indeed in the right; I should have committed a
villainous Action</i>.</p>

<p>The Prince on his Return from <i>Italy</i> to <i>Dessau</i> shew'd that Time and
Absence had not that Effect upon him as they generally have upon Lovers.
He returned as much in love with Madamoiselle <i>de Fohsen</i> as he was at
setting out. He married her in 1698, and soon after, <i>viz.</i> in 1701, she
was by the Emperor acknowledged a Princess of the Empire. He has had five
Sons and two Daughters by her, the eldest of whom is dead.</p>

<p>But the Embraces of a tender Spouse cou'd not keep him at home; a Warrior
he was born, and a Warrior he would be. The War being then kindled between
the Emperor and the <i>French</i>, the Prince went to serve in the Army on the
<i>Rhine</i>, and was present at the taking of <i>Keiserswaert</i>. Soon after, King
<i>Frederic</i> I. gave him the Command of 6000 Men, whom he sent to the
Emperor's Assistance in <i>Italy</i>, where he signaliz'd himself in every
Campaign, but especially at the raising of the Siege of <i>Turin</i>. The Duke
of <i>Savoy</i>, afterwards King of <i>Sardinia</i>, with whom the Prince had not a
very good Understanding, doing me the Honour to talk to me about him one
day, said, <i>The Prince of <span class="f">Anhalt</span> has too much Fire; but when he is ripen'd
by Age, he will be a great General. He was born with the Genius of a
Captain, and he has contributed to save my Crown</i>.</p>

<!--065.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>When a Neutrality was agreed on for <i>Italy</i> between the Emperor, his
Allies, and <i>France</i>, the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> was recall'd, and the King
gave him the Command of his Troops in <i>Flanders</i>, where he maintain'd the
Reputation which he had acquir'd in <i>Italy</i>, and was continued in his
Command till the Peace of <i>Utrecht</i>.</p>

<p>The Obstinacy of <i>Charles</i> XII. King of <i>Sweden</i> in refusing to hearken to
a Treaty for the Sequestration of <i>Stetin</i>, having oblig'd the King of
<i>Prussia</i> to make war upon him, the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> serving under the
King, who then commanded his Army in Person, had the Honour to defend the
Isle of <i>Rugen</i>, against the King of <i>Sweden</i>, who came in the Night and
attack'd it with Fury; but the <i>Swedes</i> were repulsed, after having lost a
number of considerable Officers in the Action. Since the Treaty with
<i>Sweden</i>, this Prince has had no occasion to signalize his Valour. He
resides commonly at <i>Dessau</i>, or at <i>Magdebourg</i>; and does not come to
Court but when Affairs call him. He has three Sons in the King's Service,
of whom the two eldest have Regiments of their own, and the third commands
his Father's.</p>

<p>The King, who has a great Affection for the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i>, makes no
considerable Regulation with regard to his Troops, or in any thing
relating to the War-Office, without his Advice. His Majesty has given him
considerable Tracts of Land in <i>Prussia</i>, where 'tis said the Prince is
building not only Villages, but entire Towns.</p>

<p>M. <i>d'Arnheim</i> is the third Marshal. This old Gentleman, who is past
fourscore, learnt the Art of War under two Great Masters, the Elector
<i>Frederic-William</i> of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, and <i>Montecuculi</i> the Rival of
<i>Turenne</i>.</p>

<p>The Marshal <i>de Natzmer</i> is an old Soldier also, who has serv'd under
several Commanders with very
great<!--066.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Distinction; particularly the Prince
of <i>Waldeck</i>, General of the <i>Dutch</i> Forces, the Prince of <i>Orange</i>
afterwards King of <i>England</i>, and lastly under the Duke of <i>Marlborough</i>
and Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i>; who had all an Esteem for his Valour and
Military Experience; this Marshal having been in all the Battles which
those Generals fought in the <i>Netherlands</i>, and having been always wounded
or had a Horse shot under him.</p>

<p>After having mentioned the chief Commanders of the King's Forces to you, I
think it incumbent on me to give you an Account of those Persons whose
Credit or Employments have the greatest Influence upon the Government; in
which you will please to excuse me, if I do not follow that Order I have
hitherto observ'd in my Narrative.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>d'Ilgen</i> First Minister of State, was born of an obscure Family
in <i>Westphalia</i>. After he had finished his Studies, he commenc'd Secretary
to M. <i>de Meinders</i>, Minister of State to the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>,
and to King <i>Frederic</i> I. His Discretion and his Industry soon procur'd
him the Favour of his Master, who put him Governour over his Nephew the
Baron <i>de Heidekam</i>. M. <i>d'Ilgen</i> travell'd with the young Baron to
<i>Holland</i>, <i>England</i>, and <i>France</i>, in which Tour they spent two Years. At
his Return to <i>Berlin</i>, M. <i>de Meinders</i> enter'd him in Business, and the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i> dying not long after, he procur'd him the
Office of Secretary to the new Elector. In this Employment he behav'd with
such Circumspection that he is still continued in it, notwithstanding the
many Changes that have happen'd in the Ministry. The Baron <i>de Fuchs</i> one
of the most able Ministers that ever <i>Germany</i> produc'd, being charm'd
with his Genius, gave him such a Recommendation to the late King, that he
preferr'd him to a Seat in the Council, where <i>Ilgen</i> soon found out the
way to make himself necessary.
The<!--067.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>, whose Abilities
were not so great but he stood in need of a Second, being then at the Head
of the Council, consulted in all matters with M. <i>d'Ilgen</i>, who, after the
Count <i>de Wartemberg</i> retired, had the Province of Foreign Affairs
committed to him solely, and has kept it ever since.</p>

<p>M. <i>d'Ilgen</i> has both Gaiety and Solidity in his Temper, a lively,
fruitful Imagination, and most pleasing Aspect. He is extremely sober, and
an excellent &OElig;conomist, being as great an Enemy to Pleasure, as he is a
Friend to Riches. He is humble sometimes, even to excess; revengeful,
crafty; a Master of his Temper, his Countenance, his Tongue, and his Eyes,
which he accommodates altogether to the Situation of his Affairs. As by
his Parts he raised himself, so by his Parts he supports himself. He is
the sole Repositary of his own Secrets, having no Confident nor Favourite
to share them. He is so indefatigable, that he composes and writes all
himself, keeping his Secretaries only to copy. In short, he works like a
Day-labourer, and makes the Ministry, as it were, a Handicraft. He speaks
well, but writes better; he affects <i>double Entendres</i> in his Answers, and
artfully has recourse, when he needs it, to an ambiguous Expression. He
has so little scruple, in point of Oaths, that he takes and breaks them
with equal Indifference. He never made himself a Creature, but always
removed and humbled those that ever gave him any Umbrage. That which
heightens his Character, and proves his Genius, is, that he has supported
himself a long time, without Kindred, Friends, or Creatures, and perhaps
without being too much honoured by the Favour of his Master<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Grumkau</i> Minister of State, Lieutenant-General of the King's
Forces, Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Knight of the Orders of St.
<i>Andrew</i> of <i>Muscovy</i>, and of the White Eagle of <i>Poland</i>, is descended of
an illustrious Family in <i>Pomerania</i>. His Father was Grand Marshal of the
Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, and died in that Post, at the beginning of the
late King's Reign. M. <i>de Grumkau</i> being left a Minor, was sent very young
to <i>France</i>, to learn his Exercises, where he acquitted himself with
Diligence, and the Approbation of his Superiors. At his return to
<i>Berlin</i>, <i>Frederic</i> I. appointed him Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, and
gave him a Company of Foot. Soon after which, he married Madamoiselle <i>de
la Chevallerie</i>, who was Maid of Honour to the Queen <i>Sophia-Charlotte</i>.
It was not long before he was advanced; and during the last War he served
as a Brigadier in the Army in the <i>Netherlands</i>. At the same time he had
the Care of the King's Affairs with my Lord Duke of <i>Marlborough</i>, and
Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i>. His manner of</p>

<!--069.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>Behaviour shew'd that he was fit to be employ'd in great Affairs: but the
Count <i>Wartemberg</i>, the Favourite, and Prime Minister, being jealous of
his Genius, kept him as much as he could out of any Share in Authority,
and chose rather to prefer him by War, than to employ him in the Ministry.
The Favourites (Messieurs <i>de Camke</i>) who succeeded <i>Wartemberg</i>,
perceiving M. <i>de Grumkau</i>'s superior Abilities, were not more favourable
to him than the Count was. He was preferr'd to be a Major-General at one
of the last Promotions that was made by the late King; and
<i>Frederic-William</i>, on his Accession to the Throne, made him
Lieutenant-General, and Minister of State.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Grumkau</i> is good-natur'd, civil, and affable. He has the Manners
and Sentiments of a Man of Quality, as he really is; he is generous,
liberal, loves Splendor and Pleasures, but is not so much addicted to them
as to neglect the Affairs of the Ministry. He is laborious, has a clear
and quick Apprehension; a pleasant, lively, and penetrating Fancy; and is
no Enemy to Satyr, when it does not attack his Neighbour's Reputation. As
he is of a beneficent Temper, he has Friends, and makes himself Creatures.
Of all the Ministers, he speaks to the King with the greatest Freedom; and
I believe one may safely venture to put him in the Rank of Favourites.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Kniphausen</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, Minister of State, and Commander of the
Order of St. <i>John</i>, is descended of an illustrious Family in
<i>East-Friesland</i>. In the late King's time, his Father was President of the
Chamber, which is properly, Superintendant of the Finances. No Minister
has been employed in more Embassies. He was the King's Resident in
<i>Spain</i>, with <i>Charles</i> III. the present Emperor;
he<!--070.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
was the same in
<i>Denmark</i>, <i>Muscovy</i>, and <i>France</i>; and every where supported the Dignity
of his Master, and the Honour of his Character. So many Embassies had very
much disconcerted his Affairs; and talking to me one day at <i>Paris</i> about
his Lady, who was the Daughter of M. <i>d'Ilgen</i>, 'I know, <i>said he</i>, that
her Rank is not equal to mine, and that I may be reproach'd for having
married her; but I can return the same Answer which they report of the
Count <i>de Lude</i> (Governor to <i>Gaston</i> of <i>France</i>, <i>Lewis</i> XIIIth's
Brother) who, when he was ruin'd like me, married a Tradesman's Daughter;
<i>Could I do better</i>, said he, <i>when I was persecuted Day and Night by my
Creditors, than to take Refuge in a Shop, rather than be carried to an
Alms-House</i>?'</p>

<p>M. <i>de Kniphausen</i> has a wonderful natural Genius, and would have every
Talent requisite for a Minister, if he was not quite so averse to Labour;
but being as lazy as his Father-in-Law is laborious, Affairs suffer in his
hands by delay. Not but that he knows how to dispatch them, if he will,
for nobody is more lively nor more vigilant than he, when he sets his
heart upon a thing; but he is naturally indolent, being fond of his Ease
and good Cheer.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Gohren</i>, who is Director of the Chamber of Finances, and of
the Post-Office, is a Man of a good Family in the Marquisate of
<i>Brandenburg</i>. He has not been many years in the Ministry, but has the
Reputation of an upright Man, and one not to be corrupted. He is very
reserved, and a Person of few Words, which gives him an Air that those who
are not conversant with him mistake for Haughtiness.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Creutz</i> has a happy Physiognomy, being a mixture of hard Features
with mild ones, that carry an Air of Probity and Frankness, which of all
external Appearances is undoubtedly the
most<!--071.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
advantageous. He is polite,
and magnificent; has an extraordinary Vivacity, an admirable Facility of
expressing himself, and an easy, affable, and genteel Behaviour. He never
promises but when he means to perform, and his Word may be safely depended
on. I always found him very sincere, and I cannot help saying, I love him.
<i>Frederic-William</i> called him to his Councils, he having been his
Secretary when he was Prince Royal. His Assiduity and Punctuality in
performing the Duties of his Office, had procured him the King's Affection
to such a degree that his Majesty continues to honour him with his
Good-will, and gives heed to his Representations<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Creutz</i> is one of the richest Subjects in the Country, having had a
very great Estate by his Wife: She has also brought him a Daughter, an
only Child, who is said to have a great deal of Wit; and being a rich
Heiress into the bargain, she will not fail of Suitors.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Vierec</i> is a Man of Quality, and a Native of <i>Mecklemburg</i>; his
Father was Counsellor of State to the late King, and his Envoy
Extraordinary in <i>Denmark</i>. The Son, of whom I am now writing, quitted the
Service of Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i> of <i>Brunswic-Wolfembuttle</i>, to be a
Gentleman of the late King's Bed-chamber. When he came to Court, he had no
Relations there, but he was so happy as to raise himself Friends; for his
modest Air, and his polite and submissive Deportment, gain'd him the
Good-will of the Favourites; and as he lov'd Play, he soon made himself
acquainted with
the<!--072.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Court-Ladies, who always gave him their good Word.</p>

<p>In 1711, when the Count <i>de Dohna</i> went as the King's Ambassador to
<i>Francfort</i>, for the Election of an Emperor, he desir'd of the King that
M. <i>de Vierec</i>, who was reckon'd the most sober young Man at Court, might
be Marshal of the Embassy, which was perform'd at the King's Expence. M.
<i>de Vierec</i> acquitted himself so well in that Employment, that he had the
same Post at the Congress of <i>Utrecht</i>. He had afterwards, for a while,
the Care of the King's Affairs at the Court of <i>France</i>, when the Duke of
<i>Orleans</i> was Regent; and at his Return from thence, he was employed in
the Regency of <i>Cleves</i>; from whence he was called home to better
Preferment, by means of <i>Gerstorf</i>, whose Daughter he had married. For
this General's only Son being killed in <i>Sicily</i>, his Majesty, in order to
comfort the Father, whom he lov'd, and who he saw took it very much to
heart, declared M. <i>de Vierec</i> his Son-in-Law, Minister of State. M. <i>de
Gerstorf</i>'s Daughter dying afterwards, M. <i>de Vierec</i> thereby came
possessed of a very great Estate, and married again to the Daughter of the
Count <i>de Finck</i>, who was formerly the Prince Royal's Governor.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Vierec</i> is perfectly polite, and altogether as modest now as he was
before he was a Minister; but he is close and reserv'd, mysterious more
than needs must, and jealous. His Circumspection, which extends to the
minutest things, gave him the Air of a Minister, before he had a thought,
perhaps, of ever being one. What with his Kindred, his Estate, and his
Preferment, he is become powerful at Court.</p>

<p>These, Sir, are the Persons of the greatest Consequence at the Court of
<i>Prussia</i>, with whom I had a particular Acquaintance. I am not so vain as
to think I have painted them in their true
Colours;<!--073.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
but such as they
appear'd to be in my eyes, I have represented them to you. Men are not
always the same; nor do they appear in the same light to all that see
them; every Man having his own way of thinking, and few judging solidly.</p>

<p>I have now told you all the Particulars that I know of this Court. What
remains for me is to mention some things to you, which are worth your
seeing, if ever you live to come hither.</p>

<p>Such are the King's Cabinets of Medals and Antiquities; that of Natural
Curiosities, in which are a great many things not to be seen elsewhere;
the Chymical Laboratory, with its Furnaces and Instruments of a new
Invention; the magnificent Theatre, which the King caused to be built for
Anatomical Demonstrations, with all the Curiosities and Instruments which
are there kept; the Royal Library, one of the most valuable and compleat
in all <i>Germany</i>, where, besides scarce Books and Manuscripts, is a very
curious <i>Chinese</i> Printing-Press.</p>

<p>All these things would be worth particularizing; but to do this, a Man
must have a larger Acquaintance here than I pretend to: Besides, my
Relation is already spun to such a length that I believe 'tis time to
conclude it.</p>

<p>I will, however, just acquaint you of a Foundation by the present King, in
favour of the young Gentlemen of his Dominions, which are the Academies of
Cadets, in <i>Berlin</i>, <i>Magdebourg</i>, and other Towns, where they are taught
the Rudiments of War; so that 'tis a Nursery from whence the King makes a
Draught of good Officers. His Majesty has moreover ordered his Generals of
Foot to take each a young Gentleman, whose Fortune does not happen to be
equal to his Birth, to keep them as Pages, and to make them learn their
Exercises, and every thing that an Officer ought
to<!--074.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
know. An excellent
Institution this, and a fine Resource for the poor Nobility!</p>

<p>I am preparing to set out forthwith for <i>Hamburgh</i>, <i>Hanover</i>, and the
Court of <i>Brunswic</i>; and after I have made that Tour, you shall have a
second Letter from me. Mean time, I am, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER II.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Hamburgh, June 20, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>Nothing gives me greater pleasure, than the Approbation with which you are
pleased to honour the Account I sent you of the Court of <i>Prussia</i>; which
I esteem as an infinite Reward for the little trouble it cost me. You must
not imagine that I can ever be weary of writing to you; I can never do any
thing more agreeable to myself, than to contribute to your Amusement; and
shall think myself exceeding happy, if I can succeed.</p>

<p>I set out from <i>Berlin</i> upon the 10th of <i>June</i>, and in less than four
Hours came to <span class="smcap">Oranjebourg</span>, a royal Seat, which King <i>Frederic</i> I. caused
to be built, and to which he gave the Name of <i>Oranjebourg</i>, to perpetuate
the Memory of his Mother, who was born Princess of <i>Orange</i>. This Prince,
great in every Action, spar'd no Cost to render this House worthy of his
magnificent Taste. The Situation of this Place is very charming, in the
midst of fine large Meadows, with Canals cut in them after the manner of
<i>Holland</i>. The Apartments of the
Palace<!--075.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
are grand, tho' the rich
Furniture it had formerly has been removed to <i>Berlin</i>. The present King
not taking a fancy to it, all runs to ruin; the Gardens, which were the
finest in <i>Germany</i>, are not kept in order; the great Vessels of
Porcellane; which were not to be match'd in <i>Europe</i>, the late King having
procur'd the choicest Rarities of that Ware, that were in the Magazines of
<i>Holland</i>; all these fine things, I say, are pass'd into the hands of the
King of <i>Poland</i>, at <i>Dresden</i>. The Gallery and the Salon of
<i>Oranjebourg</i>, which were furnish'd with them, and which were reckoned
among the Beauties of <i>Germany</i>, are of no account now but for the
Richness of their Cielings.</p>

<p>From <i>Oranjebourg</i>, I went and lay at <span class="smcap">Ferbellin</span>, a Town which is only
remarkable for a Victory gain'd here by the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>
over the <i>Swedes</i>. The latter enter'd his Dominions, while he was engag'd
with his Army in defence of the Empire then attack'd by the <i>French</i> on
the <i>Upper Rhine</i>. The Elector being inform'd of the Invasion of his own
Country by the <i>Swedes</i>, came away from the <i>Rhine</i> with his Troops, and
by one of the bravest Marches that ever any General made, deliver'd it
from the Enemy. He surprized them in <i>Ratenau</i>, a Town in the Marquisate
of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, the Garrison of which he made Prisoners; and then
continuing his March, he came up with the <i>Swedes</i> near <i>Ferbellin</i>, at a
time when the latter thought him still upon the <i>Rhine</i>, and gain'd a
compleat Victory. A venerable old Gentleman, who was very near the
Elector's Person at this Battle, told me, that before the Engagement
began, the Prince being at the head of his Army, took out his Pistols,
fir'd them in the Air, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, said, <i>'Tis to
thy Glory, </i><span class="smcap">Great God</span><i>, that I discharge my Arms; defend my Cause, thou
knowest it to be just; punish my
Enemies</i>.<!--076.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Then drawing his Sword, and
turning about to his Soldiers, <i>My Comrades</i>, said he, <i>I desire no other
Defence, nor no other Weapons, but the Protection of God, your Courage,
and my Sword. Follow me therefore, my Friends, do as I do, and be assur'd
of Victory</i>.</p>

<p>In this Battle, <i>Forbenius</i>, the Elector's Gentleman of the Horse,
perceiving that a white Steed which his Master rode, made his Person a
very plain Mark for his Enemy, so that they had singled him out to fire
at, desir'd the Prince to change Horses with him. The Elector, who had a
great Soul, above all Fear, refus'd at first to do so, but upon the
repeated Instances of <i>Forbenius</i>, he consented to it; and the Moment that
the Gentleman mounted the Horse which the Elector quitted, a Cannon-Shot
kill'd him dead upon the Place, so quick, that he expir'd without the
Comfort of knowing that he had thereby preserved the Life of his Master.</p>

<p><i>HAMBURGH</i>, a Hanse-Town in the Circle of Lower <i>Saxony</i>, is, without
dispute, one of the richest and most considerable Towns in all the Empire
of <i>Germany</i>. It depends solely upon its Magistrates, who are chose by the
Burgers themselves. Its Liberty has been often contested by the Kings of
<i>Denmark</i>, who as Dukes of <i>Holstein</i>, pretend that <i>Hamburgh</i> is built
upon their Territory, and that therefore they ought to be the Sovereigns
of it. The Electors of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, and the Princes of the House of
<i>Brunswic</i>, always opposed the Incroachments of the <i>Danes</i>; nor will they
suffer any Power whatsoever to oppress the City of <i>Hamburgh</i>, because, if
it were possible, they would be glad to annex it to their own Domains. The
City being exposed to these Attacks, has taken all the Measures possible
to be in a condition to defend its Liberty. 'Tis very well fortified,
maintains a
good<!--077.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Garrison, and has an Arsenal provided with all
Necessaries.</p>

<p>The Commerce of <i>Hamburgh</i> is considerable, tho' 'tis very much lessen'd
since <i>Frederic</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>, prohibited the Importation of
Merchandize from <i>Hamburgh</i> to his Dominions<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>The manner of living in this City is different from that of all the Hanse
Towns. Here is a tolerable Opera all the Year round<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; charming Walks,
choice Company, much Visiting and hearty Cheer. There are several good
Houses of the Nobility, where Foreigners are well receiv'd. The Merchants
are affable and civil; most of them in their youth travel to the most
remarkable Countries of <i>Europe</i>, where they then pass for Gentlemen of
<i>Holstein</i>. As they are rich, they can easily afford to make a good
Appearance where-ever they come. There they learn that polite Air, and
that Behaviour which one would wish to see in all Gentlemen of good
Families. The only thing for which I find fault with them, is, that they
treat their Wives too much like the <i>Levant</i> People, where the Women are
only suffer'd to go to the Mosques; so here, the Women scarce go any where
but to Church, or if they at any time take the Air, 'tis in company with
<!--078.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>their
Husbands: and a Foreigner is so seldom admitted to their
Assemblies, that when he is, those poor Women are as much astonish'd at
the sight of him, as a Sultana would be to see a Capuchin enter the
<i>Seraglio</i>.</p>

<p>There's a great many worthy People here. I have made an Acquaintance with
M. <i>de Brocks</i>, one of the Magistrates, who has acquir'd a Reputation for
his Skill in Poetry, by such Compositions as cannot but convince
Foreigners, who understand the <i>High-Dutch</i>, that as good things may be
said in that Language, as in any other<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. This M. <i>de Brocks</i> is of an
amiable Character, civil, and complaisant, and has acquir'd the Love and
Esteem of all that know him.</p>

<p>Most of the <i>European</i> Princes have Residents here, for which reason here
are several Chappels of the <i>Roman</i> Catholicks, who otherwise would be
obliged to go to the Church at <i>Altena</i>, as the <i>Calvinists</i> are forc'd to
do, the <i>Lutheran</i> being the Religion that is uppermost at <i>Hamburgh</i>; but
the <i>Jews</i> have their Synagogues here. What an odd Establishment is this
in a Christian Country!<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> how uncharitable, and even nonsensical! and
how must it make the <i>Turks</i> laugh! We grant Synagogues to the <i>Jews</i>, the
Enemies of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, who would crucify him again, if they had not done
it already; and we refuse Churches and
Temples<!--079.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
to those that believe as
we do in <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>! No, were you to call me Heretic a thousand times, I
would say, <span class="smcap">Holland for ever!</span> where 'tis a Maxim, to leave every Man to his
Conscience; and where they think it would be a Contradiction to admit
People to be their Fellow-Citizens, and to deny them the Liberty of
worshipping God in their own way.</p>

<p>The Emperor's Minister, who has the Title of <i>His Imperial Majesty's
Plenipotentiary</i> to the Circle of Lower <i>Saxony</i>, commonly resides at
<i>Hamburgh</i>. The last Gentleman that had this Employment was the Count <i>de
Metsch</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; and since his being made Vice-President of the Emperor's
<i>Aulic</i> Council, it has not been fill'd up<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>The Populace of <i>Hamburgh</i>, just such another ungovernable Herd as the
<i>Amsterdam</i> Mobs, having taken it into their heads some years ago, out of
a mad sort of Zeal for Religion, to plunder the House and Chapel of the
Emperor's Resident; the City in order to make Satisfaction for the Insult,
was condemned to build a House which was to be the Residence of the
Emperor's Minister always for the future. For this end, the City bought
the Palace of the late Baron <i>de Gortz</i>, a Man of great Fame in the
History of <i>Charles</i> XII. King of <i>Sweden</i>; and whose Fortune and
Catastrophe are worthy your notice.</p>

<p><i>Henry</i> Baron <i>de Gortz</i> was born of an independent Family in <i>Franconia</i>,
which is a Province that abounds with Nobility of Distinction. He enter'd
young into the Service of the Duke of <i>Holstein-Schleswic</i>, and rose to be
his Minister. He was a Man
generous,<!--080.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
noble, and magnificent, even to
Profusion; vigilant, full of Projects and Stratagems; a Man whom nothing
could surprize, nothing dissuade from a Design that he had once form'd;
whose Ambition was boundless, and who always aim'd to do something to be
talk'd of. In the <i>North</i> there was no Intrigue in which he had not a
hand, and into which he did not likewise draw his Master, whom he push'd
upon Enterprizes so far above his Power to execute, that he thereby lost
his Dominions. The Baron <i>de Gortz</i> thought <i>Holstein</i> too narrow a Sphere
for him to move in, and therefore he attach'd himself to <i>Charles</i> XII.
King of <i>Sweden</i>, after that Prince return'd from his long Stay at
<i>Bender</i>. <i>Charles</i> was just such a Master as the Baron wanted, and he
just such a Minister as was necessary for the King of <i>Sweden</i>; nor was
there ever in the World a greater Sympathy between two Men. <i>Gortz</i> was
born to form great Designs, <i>Charles</i> to put them in execution; and the
constant Design of both was only to throw <i>Europe</i> into a Ferment.</p>

<p>The Baron, besides other happy Gifts of Nature, had the Talent of
insinuating and pleasing. He soon got an Ascendant over <i>Charles</i>, to such
a degree that tho' this Prince was never to be advis'd by his Ministers,
yet the Baron's Opinion was a Law to him. <i>Gortz</i> frighten'd <i>Europe</i>, and
made <i>Sweden</i> tremble; being as much fear'd and dreaded there as the King
himself. The <i>Swedes</i> were uneasy to see so great a Share of Authority
vested in a Foreigner; and therefore form'd Parties and Cabals to strip
him of it; but they durst not discover their Designs. The Minister knew
all the while they envy'd him, but was in no manner of Concern about it;
for being sure of the Favour of the King, he despised the
Hatred,<!--081.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
both of
the Populace and the Great Men<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>But after the Death of <i>Charles</i> XII. who was killed at the Siege of
<i>Frederickshall</i>, in the Month of <i>December</i>, the <i>Swedes</i> did not fail to
punish him; for the Baron, before he cou'd have Intelligence of the King's
Death, was actually put under an Arrest; and upon that Occasion he said to
the Officer, <i>Surely the King must be dead!</i> From that Moment he was never
once heard to complain or murmur; for he was intrepid even to Death; the
Sentence of which he received with a wonderful Constancy of Mind, chose to
die like a Philosopher, and thought too freely of Religion to the very
last. A Divine, who is now one of the King of <i>Denmark</i>'s Chaplains,
turn'd his Heart, and brought him to acknowledge that 'twas the Hand of
God which smote him. He was conducted to the Place of Execution in a
mourning Coach, in which the Chaplain rode with him. He had a long Robe of
black Velvet, ty'd with Ribbands over his Shoulders; and as he was
mounting the Scaffold, which was hung with black Cloth, perceiving one
<i>Duval</i>, a <i>Frenchman</i>, who was his Steward, he held out his Hand, saying,
<i>Farewell <span class="f">Duval</span>, I shall eat no more of thy Soups</i>. When he was on the
Scaffold, an Officer of Justice read a Paper to him with a loud Voice; in
which it was declared that he was degraded from the Rank of Nobility, and
that the Queen had order'd him to be beheaded. <i>Alas!</i> said he, <i>I am born
a free Baron of the Empire. <span class="f">Sweden</span> cannot take from me what it never gave
me; and if I had really deserv'd to be degraded, none has a Right to do it
but the <span class="f">Emperor</span>.</i> Having requir'd one of his Valets de
Chambre<!--082.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
to undress
him, he deliver'd the Ribband of the Order of the Black Eagle of <i>Prussia</i>
to a Gentleman who stood near him, and enjoin'd him to carry it to one of
his Kindred, that he might return it to the King of <i>Prussia</i>. Then he
fell on his Knees, without shewing the least Sign of Fear; and receiv'd
the Stroke of Death with a Constancy of which there are very few Examples.
His Head being exposed to the People, was a pleasing Victim to their
Hatred and Revenge. The Baron's Corpse was interr'd, at the Place of
Execution, from whence one of his Footmen took it away in the Night-time,
put it into a Barrel, and carry'd it to <i>Hamburgh</i>; where it was laid upon
a Bed of State, and bury'd with all the Formalities fitting the Rank which
he had held in the World.</p>

<p>Within a Cannon-Shot of <i>Hamburgh</i>, stands the Town of <span class="smcap">Altena</span>, which
belongs to the King of <i>Denmark</i>. The <i>Swedish</i> General, <i>Steinbock</i>,
reduc'd it to Ashes, the 9th of <i>January</i> 1712, by way of Reprisal, as he
said, because the <i>Danes</i> had burnt <i>Staden</i>: but there was this
Difference, that the <i>Danes</i> had besieg'd <i>Staden</i> in form, and destroy'd
it by their Bombs; whereas <i>Steinbock</i> acted the part of an Incendiary. As
soon as he appear'd before <i>Altena</i>, he sent in a Message to advise the
Inhabitants to retire with what they could carry off, for that he was
going to destroy their Town. The Magistrates came out in a Body, and
falling at his Feet, begg'd for Mercy, and offer'd him a considerable Sum
of Money. <i>Steinbock</i> insisting on more, they granted him his whole
Demand, only they desir'd Time to go to <i>Hamburgh</i> for the Money. The
merciless General would admit of no such Delay. The poor Inhabitants were
oblig'd to turn out; the Mothers carry'd out their Infants; the young
Fellows, the paralytick old Men; some groan'd under Loads of Furniture;
all lamented their
Fate,<!--083.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and uter'd Cries that wou'd have almost pierc'd
a Stone. The <i>Swedes</i> stood at the Barriers, with flaming Torches in their
Hands, to see them pass; and before the poor Inhabitants were all gone
out, they enter'd the Town, and set fire to all parts of it; not sparing
even the Vaults of the Dead.</p>

<p>Never was a greater Desolation known; but what compleated the Ruin of the
<i>Altenois</i>, was the Necessity of the Times, which was such as oblig'd the
<i>Hamburghers</i> not to entertain them. Several prejudic'd Authors have said
that the <i>Hamburghers</i>, insensible, if not overjoy'd at the Calamity of
their Neighbours, kept their Gates shut, that they might see them perish.
But the truth is, that the <i>Hamburghers</i> were oblig'd to be thus strict;
because the Plague raging at that time in <i>Holstein</i>, the Elector of
<i>Hanover</i> had forc'd them to stop all Commerce with that Country;
threatning them, that if he heard they had the least Communication with
<i>Altena</i>, he wou'd prohibit his Subjects from all manner of Correspondence
with the City of <i>Hamburgh</i>. Besides, it wou'd not have been prudent in
the <i>Hamburghers</i> to have open'd their Gates in the Night-time; for the
<i>Swedish</i> Army being so near, they could not tell but the <i>Swedes</i> might
come into the Town as well as the <i>Altenois</i>. To the Misfortune of the
Times therefore must be ascribed the Distress of the Inhabitants of
<i>Altena</i>, most of whom perished with Cold, Want, and Despair.</p>

<p><i>Frederic</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>, being touched with Compassion for the
Misfortune of his Subjects of <i>Altena</i>, relieved them as far as the
Necessity of the Times wou'd give him leave. He caus'd them to be supply'd
with Materials for rebuilding their Houses; and now <i>Altena</i> has recovered
her Losses: for the King of <i>Denmark</i> has not only granted it many new
Privileges, but has caus'd a
Harbour<!--084.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
to be made there; and does all that
is in his power to draw a Trade to it. This City being a privileg'd Place
for Bankrupts, many of that Character come from <i>Hamburgh</i> to settle here;
and there is a general Toleration for those of all Religions, who have
their Churches and Temples here; which draws such numbers of People, that
in time <i>Altena</i> will probably become <i>Hamburgh</i>, and <i>Hamburgh</i> <i>Altena</i>:
For the <i>Hamburghers</i>, on the contrary, will tolerate no Christian Sects;
tho' they grant the <i>Jews</i> the public Exercise of their Religion, as has
been already observed. The Governour of <i>Danish Holstein</i> resides here,
who is the Count <i>de Reventlau</i>, Brother to the<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>Queen of <i>Denmark</i>. I
am, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER III.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Hanover, July 5, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>This Letter is to acquaint you of some things that I remark'd in the Road
from <i>Hamburgh</i>, and in this City itself; where I have now been these
three Days.</p>

<p>I set out from <i>Hamburgh</i> the 22d of <i>June</i>, and went by Water to
<span class="smcap">Harbourg</span>, having sent my Chaise thither the Day before. This Town is a
Dependant on the Dutchy of <i>Lunenbourg</i>, and belongs to the Elector of
<i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg</i>. It has nothing very remarkable but its Castle,
which is a Pentagon, lin'd with a good Cover'd-Way. Madamoiselle
<i>d'Olbreuse</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, whom the Duke of <i>Zell</i> marry'd, had the Title of Madame
<i>de Harbourg</i>, till she was recogniz'd by the Emperor a Princess of the
Empire. For by the Laws of <i>Germany</i>, a Prince of a Sovereign Family can
marry none but a Princess, or a Countess. If he weds a private
Gentlewoman, he not only marries below himself, but his Wife does not go
by his Name; and the Children of such Marriage cannot succeed, unless the
Emperor declare the Mother a Princess; as he commonly does in favour of
Princes of antient Families.</p>

<p>Between <i>Harbourg</i> and <i>Zell</i>, which is twelve Miles, there is scarce any
thing but Heath. The Post-Stages, which are of four Miles, are very ill
<!--086.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>serv'd,
and the Inns the worst in <i>Germany</i>; all which together render
the Road extremely disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zell</span> is a little Town with great Suburbs. All its Buildings are of Timber,
except the Churches, the Castle, and the House of Correction, which are of
Brick. There is a Trade from hence to <i>Bremen</i>, by the River <i>Aller</i>.</p>

<p>After the Death of <i>George-William</i>, the last Duke of <i>Zell</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, this
City, and its Dependency, the Dutchy of <i>Lunenbourg</i>, devolv'd to his
Nephew <i>George</i>, Elector of <i>Brunswic-Hanover</i>, afterwards King of <i>Great
Britain</i>. This Prince had a Regency at <i>Zell</i>, which judged all Causes,
without any Appeal but to the Council of State at <i>Hanover</i>. The President
of it at this time, is the Baron <i>de Friesberg</i>, a Person of a good Family
in the Country of <i>Hildesheim</i>; who has been a long time the Elector's
Envoy at the Diet of <i>Ratisbon</i>, where I knew him, and received a world of
Civilities from him. He is esteem'd for the prudent Management of his
Office, and his noble manner of living. There are a great many Persons of
Quality settled at <i>Zell</i>, who for a trifling Expence enjoy the Pleasures
of agreeable Society. They visit and regale one another very much, and are
not wanting in Civilities to Foreigners. Monsieur <i>de Schulenbourgh</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>,
Lieutenant-General of the <i>Hanoverian</i> Horse,
and<!--087.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Knight of the
<i>Prussian</i> Order of the Black Eagle, is the Governour of this Town. He is
a Gentleman of good Extraction, of Behaviour, Noble, Polite, and Easy; and
though he is Father of a numerous Family, he affects to live grand, and
keeps a very good Table. One of his Sons is in the Service of <i>Prussia</i>,
the others are in that of the King of <i>England</i>. I mention them to you,
because they are worthy Gentlemen; and whoever knows them, cannot but
esteem them.</p>

<p>Here are a great many <i>French</i> People, <i>Catholick</i> as well as
<i>Protestant</i>, of whom the former have a Chapel, and the latter a Church;
but the Religion which is predominant, is the <i>Lutheran</i>. The last
Dutchess of <i>Zell</i>, of the Family of <i>Olbreuse</i>, being a <i>French</i> Woman,
fill'd her Husband's Court and Guards with her own Countrymen; who were
even preferr'd before the Natives of <i>Zell</i>. I have been told that these
<i>Frenchmen</i> really thought themselves so much at home, that there happen'd
to be one day no less than a dozen of 'em at Dinner at the Duke's Table,
who all except the Prince were <i>Frenchmen</i>; which one of them observing,
said to the Duke, <i>My Lord, this is really very pleasant; there is no
Foreigner here but you</i>!</p>

<p>In the Neighbourhood of this Town there's the Castle of <i>Ahlen</i>, where,
(about nine Years ago,) the unfortunate Daughter of the last Duke of
<i>Zell</i>, by Madamoiselle <i>d'Olbreuse</i>, ended her Days, after she had been
retir'd thither about thirty six Years: She had been promised in Marriage
to <i>Augustus-William</i>, the hereditary Prince of
<i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg-Wolfemhuttle</i>; but her Father the Duke, by the
Intrigues of the Princess <i>Sophia</i>, Dutchess of <i>Hanover</i>, marry'd her
against her Will, and against the Consent of her Mother, to the hereditary
Prince <i>George-Lewis</i>, who was afterwards King of <i>Great Britain</i>, by
Right of his Mother, and who died
in<!--088.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the Year 1727, as he came to make
the Tour of his hereditary Dominions. She was sixteen Years old at her
Marriage with that Prince, who was then twenty-two.</p>

<p>Tho' there's a good deal of Heath between <i>Zell</i> and <i>Hanover</i>, yet the
Country is very well cultivated; for the Inhabitants not only make Turfs
of the Heath for Fewel, but it serves also for Pasturage, and for Manure.
'Tis about five <i>German</i> Miles from one Town to the other, and I travell'd
it in less than five Hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanover</span>, the Capital of the Electorate of <i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg</i>, is bigger
than <i>Zell</i>. The River <i>Leine</i> divides it into the old and new Towns,
which are both encompass'd with Ramparts that scarce deserve the Name.
There is nothing very extraordinary in the Palace or Castle, which is
rather commodious than magnificent; and the Town of <i>Hanover</i>, generally
speaking, is but ill built. The most remarkable Structure in it, is the
<i>Roman Catholick</i> Church, which was granted to those of that Communion by
<i>Ernest-Augustus</i> of <i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg-Hanover</i>; that being one of the
Conditions which the Emperor <i>Leopold</i> demanded of him when he honour'd
him with the Electoral Dignity. That Prince moreover engag'd to admit of
an Apostolical Vicar in his Dominions, and to give him leave to reside at
<i>Hanover</i>, as <i>Spiga</i>, who lately died at <i>Francfort</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, did for many
Years. Divine Service is perform'd in this Church as regularly as in a
Cathedral; and they who officiate in it are Missionaries. The number of
Catholicks is very considerable; but few Persons of
Quality<!--089.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
are of that
Communion, the Nobility being all <i>Lutherans</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>George</i> I. King of <i>Great Britain</i> left his <i>German</i> Dominions to
take possession of his Kingdom, he was willing that all Affairs at
<i>Hanover</i> shou'd continue on the same footing as they were before he was
called to the Throne; and he left behind him Prince <i>Frederic</i> his
Grandson, now Prince of <i>Wales</i>; who not only had a Drawing-Room every
Day, but the same Attendance as had the Elector before he was King.</p>

<p>His Majesty King <i>George</i> II. has made no Alteration in the Establishment
of the King his Father. When he sent for the Prince of <i>Wales</i> to
<i>England</i>, he order'd the Courtiers to continue their Assemblies at the
Castle; and that his Table shou'd always be serv'd in the same manner as
if he himself was at <i>Hanover</i>. His Majesty keeps up the same number of
Gentlemen, Pages, Domestics, and Guards; and the same number of Horses,
Grooms, &amp;c. in his Stables. There's a <i>French</i> Comedy acted three times a
Week at the Palace, to which all People are admitted <i>gratis</i>; and there
are frequently Concerts, Balls and Assemblies. The Gentlemen who do the
Court-Honours at these Entertainments, and who invite Persons to dine or
sup at the King's Table, are either M. <i>de Hardenberg</i>, the Grand Marshal,
or, in his absence, the Baron <i>de Gortz</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, Chief Steward of the
Houshold; or else M. <i>de Rheden</i>, Captain of the Castle of <i>Hanover</i>.</p>

<p>In the King's absence, the Government is compos'd of a Council of State,
whereof M. <i>de Hardenberg</i> is Chief or President; which meets every day in
an Apartment of the Castle. To this all the Courts of Justice in the
Dominions of <i>Hanover</i> are subject, and accountable. The
Council<!--090.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of State
receives its Orders immediately from the King; and they are counter-signed
either by the Count <i>de Bothmar</i>, or by M. <i>de Hattorf</i>, the two <i>German</i>
Ministers that attend his Majesty's Person.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Bothmar</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is an old Gentleman, who for a long time
resided in quality of the Elector's Envoy at the Court of <i>England</i>,
where, by his prudent Management for his Master, he cherished the most
incontestable Right that a Prince can possibly have to a Crown; I mean,
the Voice of the People.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Hattorf</i> is not only the Minister's Son, but has been his
Co-adjutor, for they had both the War-Office in their Province; for which
reason they were called <i>Louvois</i> and <i>Barbesieux</i>, a Comparison which
does no Dishonour either to the one or to the other: for if the two
<i>Hattorfs</i> have not made such a Blaze in the World, 'tis because they had
not a <i>Lewis</i> XIV. for their Master, for they were not inferior to the
<i>French</i> Ministers in Capacity, and Application to Business, and had not
their Pride and Arrogance.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Munchausen</i> is one of those Ministers of State who bears the most
Sway. He is of a Temper beneficent, mild, civil, very candid, sober, and
religious. He lives with Dignity, and his House is as open to Foreigners
as any in the City.</p>

<p>The Marshal Baron <i>de Bulau</i>, is Commander in chief of the Forces<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. He
has no manner of
Dependance<!--091.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
on the Council of State, and receives his
Orders immediately from the King, by M. <i>de Hattorf</i> the Secretary at War.
The Promotion which the King makes of Officers is by the Recommendation of
M. <i>de Bulau</i>; and such as would enter into the Service must make their
Application to him. He serv'd with Distinction in the <i>Netherlands</i>, under
my Lord Duke of <i>Marlborough</i>. He has actually under his Command 18000
Men, which is the Complement of the King of <i>Great Britain</i>'s Forces, as
Elector. His Majesty indeed, keeps in pay 12000 <i>Hessians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and 4000
Men of the Troops of <i>Wolfenbuttle</i>. 'Tis true, those Forces are paid by
<i>England</i>, but to me it seems they are only to defend the King's Dominions
in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>Tho' the Sovereign is absent, yet here are not wanting Amusements; there
being many good Families, and a number of amiable Persons.</p>

<p>The lovely Countess of <i>Delitz</i>, Niece to the Dutchess of <i>Kendal</i>, cou'd
not fail of Adorers, even in the most barbarous Countries; for the Charms
of her Mind are not inferior to the Beauty, Sweetness, and Gracefulness of
her Person.</p>

<p>No Lady can have a better Temper or Behaviour than the Baroness <i>de
Bulau</i>, Daughter-in-law to the Marshal, and Daughter to the late Countess
of <i>Platen</i>: her Husband is a worthy Gentleman, and keeps a very good
House.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Platen</i>, hereditary Post-Master-General, is one of the
richest Subjects in the Electorate, and one that spends the most Money. A
Foreigner will always have cause to speak well of M. <i>de Rheden</i>, Captain
of the Castle, and M. <i>de Wagenheim</i>, the great Cup-Bearer. Messieurs
<i>d'Ilten</i><!--092.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
live splendidly; and both the Brothers, the eldest of whom is a
Colonel of the Guards, are amiable and infinitely polite. If ever you come
hither, you will certainly have reason to be fond of their Company.</p>

<p>The Situation of <i>Hanover</i> is very agreeable; and in its Neighbourhood are
several pretty Seats. Among these <i>Herenhausen</i> (the House of the <i>Lord</i>,
or the <i>Master</i>) is a Castle which was built by Order of the Elector
<i>Ernest-Augustus</i>, the King's Grandfather. This House, to which a strait
Walk leads, bears no proportion to the Magnificence of its Gardens, which
are undeniably some of the finest in all <i>Europe</i>; being particularly
adorn'd with Water-Works that throw the Water up much higher than the
famous Fountain at <i>St. Cloud</i>, which was always look'd upon as the most
considerable of the kind<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>Between <i>Hanover</i> and <i>Herenhausen</i>, there are two fine Seats; of which,
one is call'd <i>Fantasie</i>, i. e. <i>the Whim</i>; and the other, <i>Monbrillant</i>,
or, <i>Mount-Pleasant</i>. They were built by two Sisters-in-law, <i>viz.</i> Madame
<i>de Kilmanseck</i>, (who after her Husband's Death, was by King <i>George</i> I.
created Countess of <i>Arlington</i>) and the Countess of <i>Platen</i>. These two
Houses are a Proof of the good Taste of those Ladies, who were really an
Honour to <i>Germany</i>, for their Beauty, good Sense, Manners, and Genius.
They both died in their Prime, a little time after one another; my Lady
<i>Arlington</i> in <i>England</i>, and the Countess of <i>Platen</i> at <i>Hanover</i>, to
which she was not only an Ornament, but a Lustre.</p>

<!--093.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>The Dominions of <i>Hanover</i> are so considerable, that I have been assured
the Revenues are no less than six Millions of Crowns <i>per An.</i> Whether
this be true, I do not know; but I tell you what I was told myself.</p>

<p><i>Hamelen</i> upon the <i>Weser</i> is the only Town that can be reckoned a Place
of Defence. <i>Hanover</i>, <i>Zell</i>, and <i>Lunenbourg</i>, have Ramparts;
<i>Harbourg</i>, a Castle, or Citadel; but all so inconsiderable, that they are
not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>There are few Sovereigns whose Finances are in so good a Condition as this
Elector's; which has been the happy Produce of three succeeding Reigns;
and the good &OElig;conomy wherewith they were managed by the three last
Princes of the Electoral Family, has contributed infinitely to the Figure
it makes at this time. Mean-while, notwithstanding these Regulations, the
People were never oppress'd, and the Princes always lived with a Splendor
suitable to their Grandeur. <i>Ernest-Augustus</i> obtained the Electoral
Dignity, not without making great Presents to the Court of <i>Vienna</i>, at a
time too when his Power was limited to the Dutchy of <i>Hanover</i>, and the
Bishoprick of <i>Osnabrug</i>. Tho' this Prince had a numerous Family to
provide for, he lived with Splendor, was fond of Magnificence and
Pleasures, gallant, generous, and liberal; and when he died, he left no
Debts to pay, and his Finances were in a good State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> I. his Son and Successor kept up a considerable Body of Troops, and
had a very splendid Court. As his Acquisitions were great, he distributed
his Favours where-ever he was inform'd there was a Necessity; and when he
came to the Throne, he made no Reform in this Court; so that their not
seeing him was the only Token of his Absence. At his Death, he left
immense Sums in his
Treasury,<!--094.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and so glorious a Character, that his
Subjects still bless the Memory of his Reign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> II. his Son, and the Heir of his Crown, his Dominions, and Virtues,
behaves in the very same manner. While he lives and acts like a King, he
neither gives, on the one hand, into the Extravagance of vain Pomp and
Pageantry, nor on the other, into that sordid Thriftiness which debases
Royal Majesty, and extinguishes the Love of Subjects. He accumulates
Treasure without oppressing his People, who love him, and offer up their
Prayers for him, as I do for your Preservation; and</p>

<h2>LETTER IV.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Blanckenbourg, July 30, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I was six Hours travelling from <i>Hanover</i> to <span class="smcap">Brunswic</span>, the Capital of the
Dutchy of that Name, which is a very great City, with Houses for the most
part of Timber. It was formerly a Free and Imperial City, and one of the
<i>Hanse</i>-Towns; but falling under the Sovereignty of the Princes of the
House of <i>Brunswic</i>, they reduced it to a level with the other Towns of
their Dominions. It belongs to the Duke of <i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg
Wolfembuttle</i>. The Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i> began to fortify it; and his Son
<i>Augustus-William</i>, the present Duke<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
perfected<!--095.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
what remained
unfinished at his Father's Death, and made <i>Brunswic</i> a Place which cannot
be besieged without a numerous Army: But then on the other hand, it would
require such an Army to garison it as the Duke could not furnish without
the help of his Neighbours, and which besides, wou'd not perhaps be
extraordinary convenient for him to introduce. The said Duke has caused a
new Palace to be built, which is large and magnificent, and the Furniture
is rich, new, and excellently well chosen. Among the rest, there are very
fine Pictures, and a Cabinet full of Curiosities.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Blanckenbourg</i>, Brother to the Duke of <i>Wolfembuttle</i>, has a
particular Palace, where he resides in the Fair-time, but it did not
appear to me to be a House of any consequence.</p>

<p>The Fairs of <i>Brunswic</i> contribute very much to make it a rich and famous
City, there being two held every Year, and a considerable Trade carried on
at both.</p>

<p>There is very good Diversion during these Fairs; for then all the Ducal
Family is generally at <i>Brunswic</i>; to which foreign Princes come often,
and there is always a great Concourse of the Nobility. The Duke sends
every Morning to invite the Quality of both Sexes, who at Noon repair to
the Palace. The Grand Marshal, for avoiding all Disputes about Precedency,
causes the Ladies to be match'd with the Gentlemen by the drawing of
Tickets; and sometimes it happens that a
Dutchess<!--096.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
is at the lower end of
the Table, which is served with very great Magnificence and Elegance. When
there are too many Guests to sit at one Table, the two Brothers keep each
a separate Table at his own Palace. At Night, the Company repairs to the
<i>German</i> Opera, which being ended, they pass into Rooms joining to the
Theatre where they play, and sup, and then dance. The Ball is open'd by
the Gentleman who happened to draw the first Number in the Morning, and

<p>The Ducal Family of <i>Brunswic-Wolfembuttle</i> consists now but of two
Brothers; the eldest of whom, the Duke<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> <i>Augustus-William</i>, has had
three Wives, but no Issue. He is married to a Princess of
<i>Holstein-Norbourg</i>.</p>

<p>These two Princes are so far advanced in Years, that the Duke
<i>Ferdinand-Albert</i> of <i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg-Bevern</i>, Son-in-law to the Duke
of <i>Blanckenbourg</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, is looked upon as their presumptive Heir. <i>Europe</i>
produces few Princes of more distinguished Merit, who have equal
Knowledge, more Learning, and Integrity, or more Valour and Experience in
War. He has acquired a noble Reputation in <i>Hungary</i>; and he is not only a
Brother-in-law to the Emperor, but one of his favourite Generals, and has
a Regiment in his Service<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<!--097.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>His Family consists of four Sons and three Daughters<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> by his Wife
<i>Antonietta-Amelia</i> of <i>Brunswic-Blanckenbourg</i>. These are very hopeful
young Princes. The eldest, whose Name is <i>Charles</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, is of a lovely
Make, and has Sense infinitely beyond his Years. The eldest Princess,
<i>Elizabeth-Christina</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, at twelve Years of Age may pass for one that is
compleatly grown; her Air is noble and modest; her Features regular; in a
word, she is form'd to make that Prince happy who is one day to be her
Husband.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>Wolfembuttle</i> is numerous, and when assembled does not want
for Magnificence.</p>

<p>The Ministers of most Power are the Baron <i>Stein</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, and the Count <i>de
Debn</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. The
former<!--098.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
is descended of an illustrious Family in <i>Swabia</i>:
He was in the Service of the Landgrave of <i>Darmstadt</i>, and his Envoy at
the Dyet of <i>Ratisbon</i>, and several Courts, where he made himself
considerable by his Eloquence, the Justness of his Sentiments, by the Ease
with which he expresses them, and by his Politeness.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Dehn</i> is a Native of <i>Mecklemburg</i>, where he was born of a
good Family, and enter'd very young a Page to Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i> of
<i>Brunswic-Wolfembuttle</i>. He had the Happiness to please that Prince, but
much more his Successor, the Duke <i>Augustus-William</i>, who of his Page,
made him his Favourite and Minister, heaped Wealth and Honours upon him,
and match'd him to the Daughter of his Chancellor, who was one of the
richest Heiresses in all <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>The young Minister finding himself rich and powerful, quickly thought the
Court of <i>Wolfembuttle</i> too narrow a Stage for Action. He had chose the
Count <i>de Fleming</i>, Prime Minister of the King of <i>Poland</i>, for a Model.
He saw that this Minister, under pretence of important Negotiations, went
to the chief Courts of the Empire to make a Parade of his Riches; and
young <i>Dehn</i> long'd with Impatience to imitate him. He procur'd himself to
be nominated the Duke's Envoy Extraordinary to <i>Holland</i> and <i>France</i>,
where he vy'd in every respect with the Ambassadors of the chief Crowns.
In fine, after having staid about eighteen Months at <i>Paris</i>, he went away
very much lamented by the Merchants and Workmen with whom he had dealings.
He came to <i>Wolfembuttle</i> to receive the Applauses of his
Master,<!--099.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and to
rest himself after the Fatigues he had undergone in his important
Negotiations.</p>

<p>As Count <i>Fleming</i> was honoured with the Orders of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Russia</i>,
and <i>Poland</i>, his Rival too thought he could not do without one Ribbon at
least; and thinking the Order of <i>Dannebrock</i> the most proper for him,
because it was white, he demanded and obtained it of <i>Frederic</i> IV. the
King of <i>Denmark</i>. When he saw himself thus adorn'd, he procured himself
to be sent to <i>Vienna</i>. What business he had there, I know not; but he was
scarce ever from the Emperor, and in order to be nearer to his Person, he
lodged just by the Palace of the <i>Favorita</i>. He often relieved the Cares
of the Ministry by making some Entertainment or Ball. He had an admirable
Genius for Dancing, so that every body thought him the Inventor of
Country-Dances. The Emperor gave him the Title of a Count, with which he
returned to his own Court.</p>

<p>When Glory has once fir'd a noble Soul, nothing can keep it within Bounds.
The Count <i>de Dehn</i> had lost his first Wife, who left him the Heir of
three great Estates; and he married again to an amiable Lady, who return'd
him Love for Love. Tho' he was dear to his Master, yet he could not
resolve to continue at <i>Wolfembuttle</i>, because he had a Taste for nothing
but Treaties and Negotiations. He returned a second time, as Envoy
Extraordinary to the <i>States-General</i>, but did not stay long at the
<i>Hague</i>; for after having had his publick Audience, wherein he assured
their High-Mightinesses of the sincere Affection of his Master for their
Republic, and of his own personal Joy to find himself seated in an
Arm-Chair in their Assembly, he went over to <i>England</i> to reside at the
Court of his <i>Britannic</i> Majesty. He was admired for his Grandeur, as much
in <i>England</i> as elsewhere; but the Air of that Country not agreeing with
the Delicacy of his
Constitution,<!--100.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
he return'd to <i>Germany</i>; and, after
having made a tour to the chief Courts of the Empire, he is come back to
<i>Wolfembuttle</i>, where he stays in expectation that some great Event or
other will turn up, that he may be employ'd in some remarkable Embassy,
whereby <i>Europe</i>, attentive to every thing that relates to him, may have
fresh Proofs of his great Talents.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Hagen</i> is Commander in Chief of the Duke's Troops, which
actually amount to above 4000 Men, and 'tis said, that his Highness's
Revenues exceed two Millions of Crowns. His Subjects are not the worst
used of any in <i>Germany</i>. 'Tis a good fruitful Country; the Peasants, who
are sober and laborious, are as clownish and as stupid as those that herd
with the Hogs in <i>Westphalia</i>; but they are robust, strong, and good
Soldiers.</p>

<p>In <i>Brunswic</i> there is a Catholick Church which is small, but neat. The
Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i> caus'd it to be built at the time he embraced the
Catholick Religion; which he did, after full Conviction, not many Years
before his Death.</p>

<p><i>Saltzdahl</i>, a Pleasure-House belonging to the Duke, is a League from
<i>Brunswic</i>, and from <i>Wolfembuttle</i>. It was built by Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i>,
one of the most magnificent Princes of his Time, and one who had the most
elegant Taste. This House is worthy of nice Observation. It has a great
Gallery with a Collection of Pictures in it by the chief Painters, which
is not to be met with elsewhere. In one great Cabinet there is very fine
Porcellane; and in another, a vast number of Vessels and Urns painted by
<i>Raphael</i>. In short, the Curious can't want here for Entertainment.</p>

<p>The Road from <i>Brunswic</i> to <span class="smcap">Wolfembuttle</span> is as pleasant as most Roads. We
cross a little Wood through which there are several Routes cut, and
as<!--101.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
we
come near the Town, several pretty Seats appear in view.</p>

<p>The Town of <i>Wolfembuttle</i> is not half so big as <i>Brunswic</i>, nor is it
better built, the Houses being of Timber. The Fortifications seem to me to
be in good Repair. The Castle, or Ducal Palace, is ancient, and makes no
great Appearance, but 'tis commodious, and has good Lodging-Rooms. That
which most deserves the Attention of a Traveller, is the Library, which is
one of the best chosen in <i>Europe</i>, and contains very scarce Books and
Manuscripts.</p>

<p>As I had left the Court at <i>Brunswic</i> I did not stay many Hours at
<i>Wolfembuttle</i>, but came to lie here at <span class="smcap">Blanckenbourg</span>, where I have all
that Heart can wish for.</p>

<p>The Duke is as affable and as civil a Prince as any in the World. In his
Youth he visited the principal Courts of <i>Europe</i>, where he contracted a
great Politeness, and a solid Taste of Elegancy. He loves the <i>Belles
Lettres</i>, protects the Arts and Sciences, and looks out for Men of Ability
to serve him. He is magnificent, generous, a good Prince, and a kind
Master. He was at one and the same time, the Father of an Empress, and the
Grandfather of an Emperor. As a Father, he has a considerable Pension from
the Emperor of <i>Germany</i>; and as a Grandfather, he has been honour'd with
the Order of St. <i>Andrew</i> of <i>Muscovy</i>, founded by <i>Peter</i> the Great,
which is a blue Ribbon, with St. <i>Andrew</i>'s Cross appendant to it
enamell'd with blue. This Prince is also a Commander of <i>Suplenbourg</i>, a
Commandery of the Order of St. <i>John</i>, annexed to the House of <i>Brunswic</i>.
He has had three Daughters by his Wife <i>Elizabeth-Christina</i> of
<i>Oetingen</i>.</p>

<p>The Dutchess, tho' advanc'd in Years, retains an Air of Grandeur and
Majesty which strikes the Beholders, and her Features discover the Marks
of<!--102.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
that shining Beauty which she had in her Youth. But what renders this
Princess more venerable than even her Birth, is her solid Piety, her just
Discernment, her lively Imagination, her noble and easy manner of
expressing herself, and her Principles of Humanity, accompany'd with a
Generosity free from all Ostentation.</p>

<p>I had the honour to pay my Duty to her at <i>Brunswic</i>, some Years ago, when
she receiv'd me with such Tokens of Goodness as rejoic'd my very Heart;
and upon all Occasions since, she has been pleas'd to give me fresh Proofs
of it. As I can be of no service to this Princess in any Case, nor so
happy as to be able to contribute to her Glory, 'tis my Ambition to make
every one, and you, Sir, in particular, sensible of the Respect and
Attachment with which I am devoted to her, and of the grateful Sense I
have of the Benevolence with which she has honour'd me.</p>

<p>The Courtiers of <i>Blanckenbourg</i> are, like their Master, very polite. M.
<i>de Munchausen</i> is the chief of the Duke's Council, and was formerly in
the Service of the Duke of <i>Wolfembuttle</i>. He is a Gentleman of great
Learning, Labour, and Vigilance, and has a distinct and noble Manner of
Delivery. He is heartily attach'd to his Master; and the Courtiers seem'd
to me to have an Esteem and Affection for him. Men of solid Judgment, and
who have been more conversant with this Minister than I, have assured me
that he is one of the greatest Genius's at this present, in <i>Germany</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Sporck</i> is the Grand Marshal, which Employment he acquits himself
in with very great Politeness and Care. He is come of a good Family, his
<!--103.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>Father
being Minister of State, and Director of the Dutchies of <i>Zell</i>
and <i>Lunenbourg</i>. M. <i>de Polentz</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> does the Honours of the Court under
him, in quality of Great Cup-Bearer. As he had his Education at Court, he
is vastly polite; and Foreigners cannot but be pleas'd with his good
Behaviour.</p>

<p>The Duke and Dutchess delight to see Foreigners at their Court, whom they
load with Civilities, and will have them always to dine and sup with their
Highnesses. After Dinner, they take the Air, or make Visits; and in the
Evening there's an Assembly in the Dutchess's Apartment, where they play,
then sup, and afterwards every one retires. We have had a Comedy twice or
thrice, which is acted by the young People of the Family, who perform
their Parts very well; especially in the Tragedies of <i>Corneille</i> and
<i>Racine</i>, translated into <i>High-Dutch</i>.</p>

<p>The Pleasures of the Carnival are more gay, at which time the Duke makes
Entertainments: There's a Ball, a Masquerade, and Comedy at Court, every
Day; and for the time there's so great a Concourse of Strangers here from
the neighbouring Towns, that sometimes 'tis impossible to get a Lodging.</p>

<p>The Town of <span class="smcap">Blanckenbourg</span> is small, and the Houses ill built, and
inconvenient. The Duke has done all in his power to engage the Inhabitants
to build; he has offer'd them Materials <i>gratis</i>, and has moreover
endeavour'd to inspire them with a Taste for the Arts; but all without
Success.</p>

<p>I never in my whole Life, saw People more indolent and clownish than those
of <i>Blanckenbourg</i>, and the neighbouring Towns. They are so bigotted to
old Customs, that they say, <i>My Father liv'd so, and so will I; My Father
did not do this, nor will I</i>. I cannot conceive how People, so dull as
they are, and so strongly attach'd to the Institutions of their
<!--104.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>Forefathers,
came to give into <i>Luther</i>'s Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><i>Blanckenbourg</i> is a petty County, which Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i> yielded in
his Life-time to his second Son, to make him some sort of Compensation for
the Right of Primogeniture, which he had newly introduc'd into his Family,
to that Son's prejudice: For the Princes of <i>Brunswic</i> had for a long time
been us'd to a Partition of Lands in their Families. The <i>Hanover</i> Branch
was the first that abolish'd that Custom, pernicious to great Families.
Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i> was only restrain'd from it by Pr. <i>Lewis</i> his second
Son, whom he lov'd more than his eldest; and not caring to leave him
without Dominions, to the Discretion of a Brother, he gave him Possession
of this State in his Life-time; because he was of Opinion, that after his
Death, his Will wou'd have the Fate of not being executed by his
Successor, according to the Custom introduc'd among Sovereigns. With them
'tis a Right of Regale, but for us to do so, is a Crime.</p>

<p>As the County of <i>Blanckenbourg</i> does not give Admittance into the College
of Princes at the Dyet of the Empire, so it does not give the Rank of a
Sovereign Prince to the Person in possession of it. The Duke, in order to
procure himself both these Privileges, made a Treaty with the Elector of
<i>Hanover</i>, whereby he got that Prince to yield him the Vote and Seat which
he enjoy'd in the Dyet for his Dutchy of <i>Grubenhagen</i>: And the Duke, on
his part, engaged never to vote at the Dyet but in conformity to the
Sentiments of the Elector. After his Decease, or if he happens to succeed
his
Brother,<!--105.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the Vote and Session for <i>Grubenhagen</i> revert to the
Elector<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is all that I can say to you at present. Their Highnesses being
to set out in a few days for <i>Oetingen</i>, where they use to go every
Summer, I propose to go forthwith to <i>Leipsic</i> and <i>Dresden</i>: And at the
latter Place I hope to hear from you.</p>

<p>From <i>Blanckenbourg</i> we have till'd Lands, and fruitful Fields; with Woods
of Oak interspers'd all the way, till we come to <span class="smcap">Magdebourg</span>, the Capital
of a Dutchy of that Name, formerly an Archbishoprick, but secularised at
the Treaty of <i>Westphalia</i>, in favour of the House of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, to
whom that Dutchy was yielded in exchange for their resigning Hither
<i>Pomerania</i> to <i>Sweden</i>. This City has for these
two<!--106.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Centuries past,
suffer'd very much. It was besieg'd by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. who
squeez'd considerable Sums from it. But it fared worse in that unhappy War
which divided <i>Germany</i> during the space of 30 Years; for the Counts <i>de
Tilly</i> and <i>Papenheim</i> commanding the Imperial Army in 1631, took it by
Storm, put the Inhabitants to the Sword, and reduc'd the whole City almost
to Ashes. Nevertheless, 'tis since pretty well recover'd, and has some
fine Houses. The great Square before the King's Palace has few equal to it
for its Extent, and for the fine Houses that encompass it, which are all
uniform, three Stories high, and were all raised in this Reign. In this
same Square there's an Arsenal, which really is not so magnificent as that
of <i>Berlin</i>, but may be rank'd among the chief Arsenals in <i>Europe</i>. This
is a populous Town, and has a more flourishing Trade than any other City
in the King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Dominions.</p>

<p>The great Church, which was formerly the Metropolitan, is ancient, and one
of the largest and most magnificent Buildings in <i>Germany</i>. It has still
some Reliques to shew, particularly the Basin in which <i>Pilate</i> washed his
Hands, after having pass'd Sentence of Death upon our Saviour; the
Lanthorn<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> which <i>Judas</i> made use of when he went to apprehend him; a
Thorn of the Crown that was planted on his Head: and things of the like
kind.</p>

<p>The Chapter of <i>Magdebourg</i> is still, bating the change of Religion, on
the same footing as before the Reformation. The Canons must all make Proof
of their Nobility; tho' 'tis a <i>Punctilio</i> with which the King, who
confers all the Prebends and Dignities of the Chapter, sometimes
dispenses. The
present<!--107.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Provost is the Duke of <i>Saxe-Barbi</i>, who succeeded
his Father in that Dignity, which brings him in 12000 Crowns a-year. He
lives in a fine House on the great Square, fronting the Palace, built by
the Order of King <i>Frederic</i> I. who also caus'd a Citadel to be erected
here, on the other side of the <i>Elbe</i>, over which there is a Bridge. That
King began likewise to fortify the Town; and King <i>Frederic-William</i>, who
carried on, and finish'd the Fortifications, has now made <i>Magdebourg</i> one
of the most important Places in <i>Europe</i>. M. <i>de Walrave</i>, Chief Engineer,
had the Direction of those Works, which are a Proof of his great Ability.</p>

<p>The Margrave <i>Albert</i> of <i>Brandenbourg</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, Brother to the late King
<i>Frederic</i> I. is Governour of the Dutchy of <i>Magdebourg</i>; as is the Prince
of <i>Anhalt-Dessau</i> of the Town, where he has a numerous Garrison under his
command. The Arsenal, which is a fine Structure, and full of Cannon, and
small Arms, is worth seeing.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Prussia</i> having it much at heart to render <i>Magdebourg</i> a
flourishing Town, has transferr'd the Regency of the Dutchy hither, which
was heretofore at <i>Halle</i>; and for this reason there are several good
Houses in the Town. The Dutchy of <i>Magdebourg</i> is one of the best
Provinces in the <i>Prussian</i> Dominions. It has a great Income from the
<i>Elbe</i>, and the Salt-Works. The Catholicks are allowed a Toleration of
their Religion in the Dutchy, and have Churches in the Town.</p>

<p>The Roads from <i>Magdebourg</i> to <i>Leipsic</i>, are so bad at this time, by
reason of the Rains that have fallen for some Days past, that I have been
three Days in getting from the one Town to the other. Indeed I went some
Leagues out of my way, on purpose to see <span class="smcap">Barbi</span> and <span class="smcap">Cohten</span>. The first of
these Towns belongs to a Prince of the House
of<!--108.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
<i>Saxony</i>, of the Branch
of <i>Weissenfeld</i>; and has nothing considerable but the Prince's Palace,
which makes a good appearance, and has commodious Apartments, elegantly
furnished. There is a Salon, and a Closet, the Cielings of which are
painted by <i>Peine</i>, and not the worst things he has done. The Palace has
Gardens delightfully situate by the side of the <i>Elbe</i>. The Duke <i>de
Barbi</i> is the only Prince of the House of <i>Saxony</i> who professes the
<i>Calvinist</i> Religion, in which he was educated by his Father, who was at
first a <i>Lutheran</i>. This Prince is a comely handsome young Man. He married
<i>N&mdash;&mdash; de Wirtemberg-Oels</i><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, but has no Children. He has been in the
Service of <i>Prussia</i>, and is Grand Provost of the Chapter of <i>Magdebourg</i>,
and Knight of the Order of the White Eagle of <i>Poland</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cohten</span>, which is bigger than <i>Barbi</i> by one half, belongs to a Prince of
<i>Anhalt</i><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; the only one of his Branch, tho' he has had two Wives. I
desired leave to kiss his Hand; but he excused himself by pretending an
Indisposition. I have observed that petty Princes are always more
difficult of Access than great ones. The Town has no Fortifications; and I
walk'd about a good while to see if there was any thing remarkable, but
'twas to no purpose; and I was oblig'd to confine myself to my Inn, which
was one of the worst in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leipsic</span> stands in a fruitful Plain. This City, so famous for its Fairs,
and for its University,
may<!--109.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
justly pass for the Jewel of the Electorate
of <i>Saxony</i>; not only for the Beauty of its Structures, but for the
considerable Revenue which it yields to its Sovereign, the King of
<i>Poland</i>. 'Tis small, and fac'd with Ramparts, and a Ditch; but all these
Fortifications are of little consequence. Its Castle, or rather Citadel,
which joins to the Town, is a Place of greater Importance. There is always
a good Garrison and Governour in it, who is at present General
<i>Baumgarten</i>. As the Castle passes under the Denomination of the King's
House, the <i>Roman</i> Catholicks have had a Chapel there ever since
<i>Augustus</i> II. embraced their Religion.</p>

<p>The Suburbs of <i>Leipsic</i> are very large. The City has four Gates newly
built of Free-Stone, which are magnificent, tho' not according to the
Rules of Architecture.</p>

<p>At each Gate they have newly set up a Mile-Post, such as the <i>Romans</i> had
formerly. There are the like Posts at the Gates of all the Towns, and even
at the Villages in the Electorate of <i>Saxony</i>. From hence they count the
Leagues, which are divided at the end of every Quarter of a Mile, by other
Posts not so big, upon all the great Roads, shewing the Distances of the
Places, and of the chief Towns; which is a mighty Convenience to
Travellers, who were heretofore often impos'd upon by the Post-Masters, as
to the Length of the Roads.</p>

<p>The Houses of <i>Leipsic</i> are large, very high, and substantially built of
Free-Stone; and their being adorn'd with great fine Windows helps to set
them off to the Eye. The Ground-Floors of most of the Houses are
Warehouses, in which the foreign Merchants store the Goods they sell at
the Fairs, which are three in number every Year, <i>viz.</i> at
<i>New-Year's-day</i>, <i>Easter</i>, and <i>Michaelmass</i>. The Concourse of Foreigners
here at the Fair-Season, is so great that 'tis often a hard matter to get
a<!--110.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Lodging here for Love or Money. I myself saw in 1709, at the
<i>New-year's</i> Fair, the late King of <i>Prussia</i>, the King and Queen of
<i>Poland</i>, and 44 Princes or Princesses of Sovereign Families. The two
Kings and the Queen lodged at the House of <i>Appel</i>, a Merchant; where the
King of <i>Poland</i> always resides when he comes to <i>Leipsic</i>.</p>

<p>The University, formerly so famous, is very much decay'd: That of <i>Halle</i>,
its Neighbour, and its Rival, in the King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Dominions, takes
away a great many Students from it. They say that for some time past there
have been more able Professors at <i>Halle</i>, where besides 'tis much cheaper
living than at <i>Leipsic</i>; and where the Students are not such
Spendthrifts, nor so much addicted to Expence and Gallantry.</p>

<p>The Gardens of Messieurs <i>Appel</i> and <i>Pose</i>, Merchants, in the Suburbs,
are worth seeing. The first is large and magnificent: In the second are
very uncommon Plants, cultivated with very great Care. The Gardeners of
<i>Leipsic</i>, who are reckon'd the best in all <i>Germany</i>, value themselves
upon forcing Nature; so that I have seen here, at <i>Easter</i> Fair, the
Fruits, Flowers, and Pulse, of all the Seasons. The Asparagus here is
delicious, and extraordinary large. Another Nicety at <i>Leipsic</i>, is its
Larks, which are sent over all <i>Germany</i>; nay, to <i>Poland</i>, <i>Holland</i> and
<i>Denmark</i>. I was assured, but I will not vouch for the Truth of it, that
the very Custom-Duty paid for Larks at <i>Leipsic</i>, amounted to 12000 Crowns
a-year; which Sum I thought the more considerable, because I think I have
heard it said, that 60 Larks pay but a Grosh<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the Duty; judge then how
many there must be to make up the Sum of 12000 Crowns. But be it true or
false, 'tis certain that there is not a Country in the World where these
Birds are taken in such quantities;
for,<!--111.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
from <i>Michaelmass</i> to
<i>Martinmass</i>, the Fields are cover'd with 'em.</p>

<p>Another Singularity is the multitude of Nightingales, in the Woods near
<i>Leipsic</i>; whereof they take great numbers, and keep them in Cages: The
Innkeeper's Daughter, where I lodged, had seven of them; and I have seen a
great many at other Houses.</p>

<p>'Tis surprizing that so plentiful a Country as <i>Saxony</i> shou'd have no
better Ordinarys. I don't mean <i>Leipsic</i> and <i>Dresden</i>, where, considering
one is in <i>Germany</i>, we come off pretty well; tho' were it so in
<i>Holland</i>, the <i>Netherlands</i>, or in <i>France</i>, we shou'd not think
ourselves well us'd. I mean the little Towns and Villages in a Road so
frequented as that from <i>Leipsic</i> to <i>Dresden</i>. There's Provision to be
had at these Ordinarys, but then 'tis so ill dress'd, and the Houses so
nasty, that 'tis enough to turn one's Stomach.</p>

<p>Setting out from <i>Leipsic</i>, at the opening of the Gates, I came betimes to
<span class="smcap">Wermstorf</span>, or <span class="smcap">Hubertsbourg</span>, (St. <i>Hubert</i>'s Palace,) a magnificent
Hunting-Seat, which the Electoral Prince of <i>Saxony</i> is building at the
Entrance of a Forest, where there are several Roads cut. This House is
five Miles from <i>Leipsic</i>, and eight from <i>Dresden</i>; and when 'tis
finish'd, will be large and magnificent: Men are hard at work upon it, and
the main Body of it is already compleated. Their Royal Highnesses, the
Prince and Princess, generally hunt here at Spring and Autumn. The
Equipage for the Stag-hunting is very fine, the Liveries being Yellow,
with Facings of blue Velvet, and Silver Lace at all the Seams.</p>

<p>After I had walk'd an Hour or two at <i>Hubertsbourg</i>, I proceeded on my
Journey, and came to Dinner at <span class="smcap">Meissen</span>, the Capital of <i>Misnia</i>. This City
has nothing particular, besides its
Manufacture<!--112.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of Porcellane, which is
so finely painted and enamell'd with Gold, that it is more beautiful than
the Porcellane of <i>Japan</i>, and much dearer. The Invention of it is owing
to an Alchymist, or one that pretended to be such; who had persuaded a
great many People he cou'd make Gold. The King of <i>Poland</i> believ'd it as
well as others, and to make sure of his Person, caus'd him to be committed
to the Castle of <i>Konigstein</i>, three Miles from <i>Dresden</i>. There, instead
of making Gold, that solid precious Metal, which puts Mankind on
committing so many Follies, he invented Brittle Porcellane; by which, in
one Sense, he made Gold, because the great Vent of that Ware brings a deal
of Money into the Country.</p>

<p>After having pass'd the <i>Elbe</i>, over a wooden Bridge, going out of
<i>Meissen</i>, I came in less than three Hours to <span class="smcap">Dresden</span>, the Capital of the
Electorate of <i>Saxony</i>. The City is pretty large, fortify'd with Art and
Regularity; and very lightsome. Its Houses are high and substantial, the
Streets broad, strait, well pav'd, neat, and in the Night-time well
lighted. There are great Squares in it; and the whole City is so well laid
out, that <i>Dresden</i> may be rank'd among the finest in the World.</p>

<p>The <i>Elbe</i> divides it into two Parts; which are distinguished by Old and
New <i>Dresden</i>, and join'd together by a Bridge of Stone.</p>

<p>In order to give you a more perfect Idea of this City, I shall point out
to you such things as I took most notice of. I shall begin with Old
<i>Dresden</i>, which is the first that we come to from <i>Meissen</i>. At the
Entrance of the Town, on the right hand, there is a great House, called
the Palace of the <i>Indies</i>, or <i>Holland</i> House, which the King bought some
Years ago of his Prime Minister, the Marshal Count <i>de Fleming</i>. All the
Rooms of this
Palace,<!--113.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
which consists of three Stories, are so many
Closets of <i>Japan</i> and <i>China</i> Wares. I don't believe that all the
Warehouses in <i>Amsterdam</i> put together, are capable of furnishing such a
quantity of uncommon old Porcellane, as is to be found here. The value of
it is computed at a Million of Crowns. The very Houshold-Goods are
<i>Indian</i>. There is one Set of Furniture, the like of which I never saw
elsewhere: It consists of Feathers of various Colours, and all natural;
inlaid with so much Art, that it might be taken for a fine flower'd
Sattin.</p>

<p>This magnificent Palace has a Garden belonging to it, which looks towards
the <i>Elbe</i>. It is adorn'd with Statues of white Marble, which the King
caus'd to be purchas'd at <i>Rome</i>, of the Cardinals <i>Annibal</i> and
<i>Alexander Albani</i>, Nephews to <i>Clement</i> XI. These Statues are much more
priz'd here than they were at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p>Near the Palace of the <i>Indies</i> stands that of the Cadets; a magnificent
Structure built by the States of <i>Saxony</i>, for maintaining two Companies
of Cadets, all Gentlemen of the Country; who are there instructed in all
the Sciences fitting for Persons of Quality.</p>

<p>Farther up in the same Street, there is an Amphitheatre, or Area, for the
Battles of wild Beasts; of which a great number is kept for that purpose.
Here are Lions, Tigers, Bears; in short, all the fiercest Animals from the
four Quarters of the World.</p>

<p>The Bridge over the <i>Elbe</i>, which joins Old <i>Dresden</i> to the New, is
scarce to be parallel'd, either for its Length or Substance. It has lately
been made broader by forming Demy-Arches which support the Riders on each
side. The Barriers are of Iron, well wrought. An Equestrian Statue of the
King is going to be erected upon it.</p>

<!--114.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>The Palace or Castle joins to the Bridge, at the Entrance of New
<i>Dresden</i>. This is an ancient Structure, which makes but a mean
Appearance; and 'tis said, that the King intends it shall be pull'd down,
and another built in its room; and that his Majesty has set apart eight
Millions of Crowns for the Expence of it.</p>

<p>The inside of the Castle surpasses the outside. The State-Room is
splendidly furnish'd. The Great Gallery contains several Curiosities, such
as antique Busts, Vessels, and Pictures.</p>

<p>This Palace has two Chapels, one of which belongs to the <i>Roman</i>
Catholicks, and the other to the <i>Lutherans</i>. The first was heretofore the
Theatre for Operas, but the King turn'd it into a Chapel, upon account of
the Marriage of his only Son with the Archdutchess, eldest Daughter to the
Emperor <i>Joseph</i>; the second was always the Chapel of the Electors of
<i>Saxony</i>. The King might, if he pleas'd, have order'd Mass to be
celebrated in it, but he wou'd not give his Subjects that Handle for
Complaint; besides, the late Queen, his Wife, having always stuck to the
<i>Lutheran</i> Religion, in which she was born, he left her that Chapel for
her use. The Treasure of it is extremely rich, and contains Vessels,
Chasubles, and other things heretofore consecrated and given to this
Chapel by the Piety of the Electors.</p>

<p>The Royal Treasury, commonly call'd the <i>Grune Gewölbe</i>, (the Green
Vault,) is in the Palace. They are three arch'd Rooms, which contain
immense Riches, and shine all over with Gold, Precious Stones, and
Diamonds. 'Tis one of the finest Places in the World. There are several
Sets of Brilliant Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, Pearls, Saphirs, and other
Precious Stones. Every Set is compleat, and consists of Buttons for
Clothes, Loops for Hats, Swords, Hangers, Canes, Sleeve-Buttons,
<!--115.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>Shoe-Buckles,
Muffs, and Sword-Belts, Snuff-Boxes, Watches,
Tweezer-Cases, Pocket-Books; in short, all the Jewels that can possibly be
imagin'd, even to the Furniture of a Horse; so that were I to write down
every Particular, I should furnish you a Volume. And they all look the
better, for being ranged with wonderful Nicety in Cases of Crystal.</p>

<p>To the Castle belongs a Garden, call'd the <i>Zwinger Garten</i>, which is the
<i>Tuilleries</i> of <i>Dresden</i>, but not extensive enough to deserve the Name of
a Garden. 'Tis encompass'd with Buildings of Free-Stone, which are
Green-Houses for Orange-Trees. The Structure consists but of one Floor, on
which are rais'd six large Pavilions, <i>viz.</i> three in front at the
Entrance, two on the sides, and one over the Portico at the Entrance;
which have all a Communication with one another, by a Platform that has
Balustrades adorn'd with Statues. It wou'd be hard to lay what Order of
Architecture prevails most in this Edifice, the Carv'd-Work with which it
is decorated, being more of the <i>Gothic</i> than the modern Taste.</p>

<p>Near to this Building there's a Palace which makes a great Shew, but the
Apartments are by much too small, and too low for the Ornaments employ'd
about them. The King caus'd this House to be built for the Countess <i>de
Cosel</i>, at the time when that Lady was in high Favour. No Cost was spar'd
in it; but 'tis pity that a more skilful Architect had not been pitched
upon to conduct it.</p>

<p>There are five or six other Houses, which are here call'd <i>Hotels</i>, but in
<i>Italy</i> wou'd certainly pass for Palaces. The Hotel <i>de Fuhl</i> in the
Street of <i>Pirnitz</i> is one of this number. It was erected by the Great
Marshal <i>de Fuhl</i> who on his Death-bed left it to his Wife, of whom it was
purchas'd by the Count <i>de Fleming</i>. That Minister sold it
soon<!--116.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
after to
the King, who made considerable Embellishments in it, and furnished it
richly. In this Condition his Majesty gave it in 1728, to the Marshal <i>de
Wackerbarth</i>, to make him amends when he had been burnt out of the House
he liv'd in, as Governour of <i>Dresden</i>. After this, the Governour's House
being rebuilt, the King bought the other House again of the Count <i>de
Wackerbarth</i>, and has made it a Depositary of his Medals, Antiquities, and
Curiosities.</p>

<p>To be sure you have heard that this Fire broke out at the Governour's
House in the Night-time, while the King of <i>Prussia</i> was here. His Majesty
actually lodg'd at the Governour's House; and was in Bed when the Fire
burst out with such fury that he had but just time to make his Escape in
his Night-Gown, and to save a little Box in which there were Papers of
consequence; for the Floor of his Bed-Chamber fell in, the moment after
the King was gone out of it. An Officer, his Wife, and her Maid-Servant
perish'd in the Flames. The Count <i>de Wackerbarth</i> only sav'd his Wardrobe
and his Plate; for his fine Library, and a noble Collection which he had
of Drawings, one of the compleatest and best chosen Setts in <i>Europe</i>,
were consum'd.</p>

<p>The Hotel of <i>Hoyhm</i> is the most considerable Building in <i>Dresden</i>. In
about six Years time it had four different Owners. It was founded by the
King's Favourite, the Count <i>de Fitztuhm</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, his Great Chamberlain, and
Minister of State; who having been kill'd in a Duel at <i>Warsaw</i>, by the
Count
<i>de</i><!--117.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
<i>St. Gilles</i>, a <i>Piedmontese</i> that came to <i>Poland</i> to seek
his Fortune, his Widow sold it to Marshal <i>Fleming</i>, who dying at <i>Vienna</i>
not long after he had purchased it, the House fell to his Son, a weakly
Child, who did not long survive him. His Mother, who was a <i>Radzivil</i>, was
his Heiress, and one of the greatest Matches in <i>Europe</i>. She was soon
after married again to a <i>Polander</i> whom she follow'd into his own
Country; and when she left <i>Dresden</i>, she sold her House to the Count <i>de
Hoym</i>, who at present occupies it.</p>

<p>Not far from this House are the King's Stables, which are well worth
seeing, there being a great number of wonderful fine Horses, and some of
all sorts of the rarest Breeds. Over the Stables, are Rooms full of fine
Equipage, consisting of sumptuous Saddles and Housings, Sleds and
magnificent Harness. Many of these Equipages are of the <i>Turkish</i> Mode,
and plated with massy Silver, adorn'd with precious Stones.</p>

<p>The Arsenal, which is much boasted of here, cannot be reckon'd a fine one
by any but such as have not seen the Arsenal of <i>Berlin</i>, to which it is
not to be compar'd. There are several Rooms in it full of Arms, Brass
Cannon, Helmets, and Cuirasses, which are the Tapestry of Arsenals.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, you have all that I observed in <i>Dresden</i>: it remains for me to
give you some Account of its Suburbs, and of the Pleasure-Houses which the
King has in the Neighbourhood of this City.</p>

<p>The Suburbs of <i>Dresden</i> are very extensive, but have no Building of
consequence, except the Palace in the King's great Garden, built by his
Majesty's Mother, and that call'd the <i>Turkish</i> Palace, because it is
furnished entirely after the <i>Turkish</i> manner. The King gave an
Entertainment at this Palace to the Princess his Daughter-in-law, on
account
of<!--118.png--><span class="pagenum">93</span>
her Arrival at <i>Dresden</i>, which was so particular that I think
it deserves a Digression.</p>

<p>Upon the Feast-Day, the whole Court appeared at the <i>Turkish</i> Palace, in
the Habits of <i>Turks</i>. The King came in the Dress of a <i>Sultan</i>, but
without any Attendance. His Majesty was soon after follow'd by the
Princess his Daughter-in-law, with her Ladies. Her Royal Highness, for
whom the Entertainment was made, found a Body of Janizaries drawn up in
the Court-Yard of the Palace. The King receiv'd her at the Entrance of his
Apartment, and conducted her into a Hall spread with fine Tapestry, and
laid with Cushions richly embroider'd.</p>

<p>The King and Princess being seated, were served by twenty-four Negroes in
sumptuous Dresses, with Sherbet, Coffee, and Sweet-Meats, in great Vessels
of massy Silver; nor were scented Waters, and perfumed Handkerchiefs
forgot. After this Collation, they drew near the Windows to see the
<i>Pillau</i> (which is the Rice of <i>Turky</i>) and the King's Bounty-Money
distributed to the Janizaries. This was follow'd by a Comedy, with an
Entertainment of <i>Turkish</i> Dances. Then came the Supper, the Guests
sitting cross-legg'd upon the Cushions, and the Courses being served up
after the fashion of <i>Turky</i>, by the Negroes and young <i>Turks</i>. While they
were at Table, the Company was diverted by the various Leaps and Postures
of certain Tumblers and Rope-Dancers. Supper being over, they went into
the Garden, which was illuminated with several Thousands of Crystal Lamps.
There was Tilting, and shooting at the Mark, and whenever the Mark was
hit, a Sky-Rocket was sent up, which for the time seem'd to sprinkle
Thousands of Stars among those in the Firmament. After this, the Company
retir'd into the Palace, where the King and the Princess open'd the Ball,
and there was dancing till five o'clock
in<!--119.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the Morning, when the Ball was
concluded with a sumptuous Breakfast that was serv'd at the several
Tables, after the manner of our own Country; which, with the leave of the
<i>Mussulmen</i>, is as good as theirs.</p>

<p>The finest Royal Houses, are <i>Pilnitz</i> and <i>Moritzbourg</i>. The King, who is
certainly of all Sovereigns the most magnificent, keeps Men continually at
work, in embellishing those Places. The Works are carried on by the
Direction of Mons. <i>Bot</i>, whom I think to be not inferior to <i>Bernini</i>,
and I doubt not, such is my high Idea of him, that as he is supported by
the Generosity of a Great King, he will accomplish such Works as are
worthy of himself, and of his Master too.</p>

<p>I have now done with the Description of the Palaces and Royal Houses, in
which, I own I have been defective, and would gladly have been excus'd
from giving it; but you would have it, and I cou'd not help gratifying
you. I pass now to something more important; and shall entertain you with
the present State of the Royal Family, and the Characters of the most
distinguish'd Persons at Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederic-Augustus</span> II. King of <i>Poland</i>, and Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, is the
Chief of this August Family. This Monarch, whom no Man surpasses in
Strength and Dexterity, and whom few Princes equal in Generosity, is the
second Son of <i>John George</i> III. Elector of <i>Saxony</i>. He succeeded his
Brother <i>John George</i> IV. in the Electorate, and was chose King of
<i>Poland</i> after the Death of the Great <i>Sobieski</i>, notwithstanding the
Intrigues of the Emissaries of <i>France</i> who declared for the Prince of
<i>Conti</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>Frederic-Augustus</i> ascended the Throne, he brought all the Virtues
to it fitting for a Great King. The Agreeableness of his Person, his
Majestic Air, his Heroic Strength, his Good-Nature, his Politeness, and
his well-known Valour,
were<!--120.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the least of his Qualities. Never was any
Prince more magnificent, nor did any one either give more, or with a
better Grace. As a General and a Statesman, he was never too much lifted
up by Prosperity, nor shock'd by Adversity; so that he was observed, when
in the depth of his Misfortunes, to act and treat even with his Enemies,
with that Air of Complaisance and Satisfaction, which Men inur'd to great
Affairs know how to assume, in the midst of the cruellest Mortifications.
This Prince, in his Youth, travelled to the chief Countries of <i>Europe</i>,
and where-ever he came, was admir'd for his Strength, his Air, and
Dexterity. Amongst other Adventures, a very odd one befel him in his
Travels, at <i>Venice</i>. There happen'd to be in that City a famous
Astrologer, who had the Reputation of being well read in the Book of Fate.
The King, who was only Prince at that time, had a mind that he should
calculate his Nativity, and for that purpose went to the Astrologer's
House, accompanied by two Gentlemen. They were all three dress'd in plain
Apparel, and the Prince, to disguise himself still the more, had conceal'd
his brown Hair under a fair Peruke. He enter'd the last Man, into the
Astrologer's House, and seem'd to be rather as an Attendant, than a
Companion of the others. But to him the Astrologer first address'd
himself, calling him by the Titles of <i>My Lord</i> and <i>Highness</i>. The Prince
told him that his Rank in the World was much too mean for such high
Compliments; but the Astrologer made answer, he knew very well whom he
spoke to, and that it was in vain for him to think of concealing himself
from such a Man as he. The Prince and his small Retinue were then
conducted by him into a Closet, where he shewed him a Looking-Glass. <i>Cast
your Eye on that Mirror</i>, said he to the Prince, <i>and there you will see
the principal Events of your Life</i>. The Prince
without<!--121.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
any scruple,
look'd accordingly, and saw himself at first in the Habit of an Elector;
afterwards, with a Crown on his Head, and a royal Mantle on his Shoulders;
and at last, full of Wounds, and bath'd in his Blood.</p>

<p>This Story, which I should not give you for true, if I had not heard it
from a great Nobleman who told me he had it from the King's own Mouth, is
however, not without a Parallel; for it is pretended, that a Mason told
Madam <i>de Maintenon</i>, when she was no more than Madam <i>Scarron</i>, what her
Fortune and Rank would be in <i>France</i>. I could mention several other
Instances to you of the same nature, which all surprize me, tho' they
don't convince me. Be it as it will, two Articles of the Prediction made
to the King of <i>Poland</i> are fully accomplished; as to the third, may
Heaven confound the Astrologer<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Poland</i> spends part of his time in his Kingdom, and part of
it in his Electorate. 'Tis true, that he seems to take more delight in
<i>Saxony</i> than in <i>Poland</i>; and 'tis in my Opinion very natural for him to
do so; <i>Saxony</i> being his
hereditary<!--122.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Country, where he is so absolute
that his Will is the Law of his Subjects, by whom he is rather ador'd than
belov'd: besides, 'tis <i>Saxony</i> that furnishes him wherewithal to support
his Dignity, and offers him every thing conducive to the Pleasures of a
Great King; and it is there that he has a Court, the most brilliant in
<i>Europe</i>, not only for its Splendor, but for Magnificence and Pleasures;
whereas in <i>Poland</i>, he has only the vain Pageantry of Royalty; being
under greater Limitations than any Sovereign in the World; so that the
least Innovation, the least Act of Authority, makes the <i>Poles</i> clamorous,
and they presently think they are excused from paying him that Obedience
which they owe him. All the Gentlemen here are their own Masters; and the
Noblemen behave so much like Sovereigns, that they never go to Court but
to demand Favours, which if they obtain, they go away ungrateful, and if
they are deny'd, they retire with the Intention of taking a Revenge on the
first Opportunity: For the Climate being rough, the People are fierce; and
the King, tho' adored in <i>Saxony</i>, is scarce beloved in <i>Poland</i>.</p>

<p>The Electoral Prince, this King's only Son, is lusty, proper, and well
made, and like the King his Father is adroit in all bodily Exercises. He
loves Pleasure, but 'tis with Moderation, and is heartily attach'd to the
Religion which he has embrac'd. He is stiff and reserved, without being
haughty, which is a Temper that he derives from the late Queen his
Mother<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, whom he very much resembles. To such as have the Honour of
Access to him, and of being known to him, he is gracious, familiar and
very civil. His Royal Highness has been admit'd for his good Qualities in
a
great<!--123.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
part of <i>Europe</i>, particularly in <i>Germany</i>, <i>France</i>, and
<i>Italy</i>, where he has spent several Years. No Son can have more respect to
a Parent than he has for the King his Father, whose Will and Pleasure he
never oppos'd in any one Instance; and whose Person he has always honour'd
even in his Ministers. Of all Pleasures he seems to bestow most Time in
Hunting; nevertheless he makes it only as an Amusement without being
passionately fond of it. His Royal Highness's Confident is <i>Solckofski</i> or
<i>Sulkowski</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, a <i>Polish</i> Gentleman who was once his Page; and by thus
making him his Favourite, for which he cannot but be applauded, he shews
that he is capable of distinguishing true Merit. I had frequently the
Honour of making my Compliments to this Prince while he was at <i>Paris</i>,
and this is now the second time that I have had the same favour at
<i>Dresden</i>, where I find he is the same gracious Personage as ever. The
last time that I had the Honour of being introduc'd to him he talk'd a
great deal to me about <i>Paris</i>, and when he dismiss'd me, he said he was
sorry to think that <i>Dresden</i> would not afford me so many Pleasures as
<i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>The same Day that I waited on the Prince, I was introduced to the Princess
his Royal Highness's Consort, who is the late Emperor <i>Joseph</i>'s eldest
Daughter. The Voice of the People is unanimous in the Character of this
Princess. All Mankind agrees that she has not her superior for
Good-nature, Piety, Charity, Modesty, and in a word for all, the Virtue of
the Soul: To please her Husband, and to give her Children an Education
suitable to their Birth, is her principal Endeavour. 'Tis rare to find a
happier Couple than their Royal Highnesses; for Marriage, which generally
cools the warmest Passions, seems on the contrary to have animated their
<!--124.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>reciprocal
Affection to such a degree that they are a Pattern for the
Imitation of their Court.</p>

<p>Their Royal Highnesses Children are so young that I shall say but little
of them<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. Their eldest Son very much resembles the Pictures that I have
seen of the Emperor <i>Joseph</i> when he was a Child. This young Prince seems
to me to be of a very delicate Constitution, and has so great a Weakness
in his Knees that he can scarce stand: The Physicians say it will go off

<p>The two Princes of the Blood, who commonly reside at <i>Dresden</i>, are
<i>John-Adolphus</i> of <i>Saxe-Weissenfels</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, a Prince of uncommon Merit,
whose Sentiments and Actions are no disparagement to his Birth; and
<i>Maurice-William</i> of <i>Saxe-Zeits</i>, the last of his Branch. He was
persuaded by his Uncle the late Cardinal <i>de Saxe-Zeits</i> to abjure the
<i>Lutheran</i> Religion and to embrace the ecclesiastical State: He is Bishop
of <i>Konigsgratz</i> in <i>Bohemia</i>, Provost of <i>Alten Ottingen</i> in <i>Bavaria</i>,
and a Canon of <i>Cologne</i>, <i>Liege</i>, and <i>Aichstedt</i>, and is descended from
such a Family that it may be presum'd, he will some day or other, be

<div class="blockquot">N. B. <i>What follows, is a more particular Account of the
Electoral Family of <span class="f">Saxony</span>, translated from the Baron's State of
it; which is prefix'd to the second Edition of these <span class="f">Memoirs</span>.</i></div>

<p><i>Augustus</i> III. King of <i>Poland</i> Great Duke of <i>Lithuania</i> and Elector of
<i>Saxony</i>, was born the seventh of <i>October</i> 1696. He is the only Son of
<i>Augustus</i> II. the last King of <i>Poland</i> and of <i>Eberhardina</i> of
<i>Brandenbourg-Bareith</i>. His Grandmother,
<i>Anne</i><!--125.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Princess Royal of
<i>Denmark</i>, Widow of <i>John George</i> the third Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, took care
of him in his Infancy, and impress'd him with those Sentiments of Piety,
Humanity, and Justice, which render him at this day the Darling of his
People, and the Pattern of Kings.</p>

<p>At a proper Age, the King his Father took him out of the hands of the
Women, and committed him to the Care of Monsieur <i>de Miltitz</i>, a Gentleman
of a good Family; whom Learning, good Behaviour and solid Virtue render'd
worthy of such an Employment.</p>

<p>The Prince, who always found Charms in Virtue, was sensible of the Merit
of his Governor: He lov'd him, was inseparable from him, and receiv'd his
Advice with a Docility, which, at his tender Age, was a presage he wou'd
be possess'd of that Fund of Wisdom which now renders him worthy of his
Throne.</p>

<p>While the young Prince was under the Conduct of the Women, God was pleas'd
to touch the Heart of the late King his Father: That Monarch, who happen'd
to be born a <i>Lutheran</i>, was converted to the <i>Roman</i> Catholick Religion,
and not long after elected King of <i>Poland</i>; and his Majesty being
convinc'd of the Purity of the Religion which he had embrac'd, was
inclin'd to make a Convert also of the Prince his Son. Nevertheless, such
was the Respect the King had for her Royal Highness his Mother, that he
was loth that august Princess shou'd be an Eye-witness of the young
Prince's renouncing a Religion which she had taught him, and to which she
was strenuously attach'd: He resolv'd therefore to remove him, and sent
him to <i>Francfort</i> to be present at the Coronation of the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> VI. His Companion in this Journey, was M. <i>de Miltitz</i>; but as
this Gentleman's Attachment to <i>Luther</i>'s Doctrine made the King
apprehensive that he wou'd thwart his Views,
he<!--126.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
recall'd him, and
appointed the Count <i>de Costa</i>, and the Baron <i>de Hagen</i>, to be his Son's
Governors.</p>

<p>The Count who was a <i>Polander</i> and Palatine of <i>Livonia</i>, was not only of
noble Birth, but a Gentleman of solid Piety, profound Learning, great
Probity, and as much respected for his Principles as belov'd for his good
Behaviour and Politeness.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Hagen</i> was of a Family of some Distinction in the Electorate
of <i>Triers</i>: He was Ambassador from the King at the Emperor's Election,
and at his Coronation at <i>Francfort</i>: His Behaviour was more grave than
the Count <i>de Costa</i>'s, but he was not inferior to the Count for Learning,
Integrity, and good Sense.</p>

<p>Under the Conduct of these two Gentlemen, the Prince set out to visit a
part of <i>Germany</i> and <i>Italy</i>, where he embrac'd the <i>Roman</i> Catholick
Religion; his Profession of which, was however for a long time as private
as it is now exemplary; for he did not declare his alteration of Religion
'till after the Death of her most Serene Highness his Grandmother, who
died the first of <i>July</i> 1717. During this the Prince made the Tour of
<i>France</i>, where, tho' he travell'd under the Name of the Count <i>de
Misnia</i>, <i>Lewis</i> XIV. caus'd all the Honours to be paid to him which were
due to the Son of a great King.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>France</i> was charm'd with that Politeness, that noble
Modesty, and that Fund of Wisdom which accompany'd this Prince's Actions
and Conversation: They admir'd him and were sorry for his Departure. He
travell'd a second time to <i>Italy</i>, where he acquired that fine Taste of
Men and Things and that Knowledge of Architecture, Painting, and other
curious Arts, which is so useful for great Princes. <i>Germany</i>, upon the
return of this Prince, bless'd itself for having given him birth, and
offer'd up Prayers that all its Princes might be like him. His Royal
Highness stay'd a considerable while at
<i>Vienna</i>,<!--127.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
where he maintain'd the
Reputation he had acquir'd in the several Countries he had seen. He
returned at length to <i>Saxony</i>, where there was an universal Joy for his
Arrival. The <i>Saxons</i> were charm'd to see the Prince that was design'd by
Heaven to be their Sovereign, so worthy of that Command. One day or other,
they said, we shall lose the most righteous of Kings, and the best of
Masters, but we shall find restor'd in his Son, his heroic Stature, his
majestic Air, his Magnanimity, the same Temper for Goodness, Equity and
Generosity; the Spirit of the great <i>Augustus</i> will be always present with
us; and all our Loss will be that of his Personal Appearance.</p>

<p>Not long after the Prince's Return to <i>Dresden</i>, <i>Augustus Christopher</i>
Count <i>de Wackerbarth</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> treated at <i>Vienna</i> for the Marriage of his
Royal Highness to the most serene Archdutchess <i>Maria Josepha</i>, eldest
Daughter of the late Emperor <i>Joseph</i>. The Count <i>de Flemming</i>, Prime
Minister and Velt-Marshal of <i>Saxony</i>, solemnly demanded the most serene
Archdutchess in Marriage; and the Prince repair'd to <i>Vienna</i> to espouse
her. The Ceremony was perform'd in the Chapel of <i>la Favorita</i>, with all
the Pomp suitable to so great a Match. Some Days after this, their Royal
Highnesses set out for <i>Dresden</i>, where they were receiv'd with an
unparallell'd Magnificence. <i>Augustus</i> II. the most splendid of Kings, and
a Prince who had the best Fancy for ordering of Entertainments, outdid
himself; he thought nothing too good for celebrating the Nuptials of his
so worthy a Son, with a Princess whose Ancestors were all Emperors.</p>

<p>The Rejoicings having lasted forty Days, the King set out for his Kingdom,
leaving the Prince Regent, as he always did whenever he went from his
Electorate.</p>

<!--128.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>In 1726, the Prince himself took a Journey to <i>Poland</i>, to which Country
he had once before accompanied the King his Father in 1711, but then made
no long stay. There he won the Hearts of the chief Nobility, who from that
moment thought him worthy of succeeding one day to their Governor, the
Great <i>Augustus</i>. They were pleased to see, that he honour'd their
Countryman, the Count <i>Sulkowski</i>, with his Confidence, and they thought
it a happy Omen for their Nation, blessing their Stars, that the Prince
distinguished Virtue in one born among themselves.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness being convinced that of all the Sums laid out by
Princes, there are none less liable to censure than what they expend in
Buildings, undertook that of <i>Wermsdorf</i>, which he afterwards call'd
<i>Hubertsbourg</i>; and he finish'd that great Work in a little time, by the
assistance of the King his Father: For, in short, it would have been
impossible for his Royal Highness to have defray'd all the Expence of it
himself. It was already very wonderful to see with what Prudence he
directed his Finances. His Revenue being settled, his Expence was suitable
to his Rank; he had a numerous Houshold, his Hunting Equipage was
sumptuous, yet he did good to all that made their Necessity known to him;
his Charities were truly Royal, every body was paid; the Noblemen and the
Tradesmen receiv'd their Pensions and Salaries punctually; and his
Accounts were so regularly kept and discharged by the Count <i>Sulkowski</i>,
that the Prince was never in debt.</p>

<p>The Prince commonly spent the Season for hunting the Stag at
<i>Hubertsbourg</i>, and employ'd the remainder of his time at <i>Dresden</i>, in
all manner of Exercises, being admired in every Action, for the Grace,
Strength, and Dexterity with which he perform'd it, as well as for the
Sobriety and
Regularity<!--129.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
of his Manners; for he kept as regular Hours
then, as he does now.</p>

<p><i>Augustus</i> III. never knew what it was to be idle or vicious. Such is his
Chastity and Fidelity to his august Spouse, that he never gave her the
least Reason so much as to suspect his Honour. He games only for
amusement, and never plays so high that the loss of the Stake can put
those out of temper who have the Honour to be of his Party. But of all the
Virtues of <i>Augustus</i> III. there is none, most certainly, which has made
him more the Favourite of Heaven, than the inviolable Respect he always
manifested for the King his Father, who tenderly lov'd him; and never was
a Son, Heir to so powerful a Dominion, more affected for the loss of a
Father, than he was when he heard of the death of his. His Affliction was
impress'd deeply in his Countenance, when he receiv'd the homage of his
capital City, at his first appearance in publick; and to this very day, he
is ready to melt in tears at the sight of any Object that calls him to
mind; for which reason the People of <i>Dresden</i>, rather than renew his
Sorrow, forbear the mention of a King whom <i>Europe</i> has plac'd in the Rank
of its greatest Men.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Frederic-Augustus</span>, when he became Elector, did not alter his
Manners, but retain'd the same Piety, the same Regularity. He kept most of
the Servants of the late King his Father, and settled Pensions on those
whom he thought fit to dismiss. His first Care, when he came to the
Electorate, was to provide himself with Ministers, whose Candor and
Sincerity were above Envy it self. For this purpose, he call'd to his
Cabinet-Council, the Count <i>de Gabaleon-Wackerbarth-Salmour</i>, M. <i>de
Baudissin</i>, the Count <i>Sulkowski</i>, and M. <i>de Bruhl</i>; to the two last of
whom he committed the Direction of Affairs.</p>

<!--130.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>All <i>Saxony</i> applauded this Choice, and doubted not of being very happy
under the Reign of a Prince, who was capable of forming so true a Judgment
of Persons for his Ministers. But what the <i>Saxons</i> saw with extraordinary
Satisfaction, was the sure Proof the King gave of his Gratitude and Esteem
for Virtue, in recalling M. <i>de Miltitz</i>, heretofore his Governor, who for
some Years past was retired to his Estate. This Gentleman wou'd fain have
been excus'd from returning to Court, alledging his great Age, and his
being a Stranger to Business; when his Majesty sent him word, that he
requir'd no more at his hands than what his Health wou'd permit; that he
knew his Probity, his Love for his Country, and his Attachment to himself;
that therefore he was willing he shou'd be near his Person, and assist him
with his Advice, which he knew wou'd be solid, by what he gave him when he
had the charge of his Education. In this manner <span class="smcap">Frederic-Augustus</span>, by the
display of his Gratitude, an uncommon Virtue (especially among Princes)
encourag'd his Courtiers to do what might also give them a Title to it.</p>

<p>These great Qualities procur'd him the Suffrages of the most judicious
Part of the Republic of <i>Poland</i> which chose him for King. His Majesty
having sent the Count <i>de Gabaleon-Wackerbarth-Salmour</i>, and M.
<i>Baudissin</i> to <i>Warsaw</i>, with the Character of Plenipotentiaries, to take
care of his Interests, these Ministers found the <i>Polish</i> Lords very much
divided: Foreign Gold, with the Intrigues, Cabals, and ensnaring Promises
of a Minister who was lavish of it; all these had corrupted a great number
of them, and others were oppress'd, and must undoubtedly have submitted to
Violence, if they had not had a very great share of Courage and Love to
their Country. God, who never abandons the Virtuous, was their Support and
their<!--131.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Protector, as well as the Shield of the Plenipotentiaries, whose
sacred Character could not guard them from all manner of Outrage. And tho'
the Blood of the <i>Jagellons</i>, which flows in this Prince's Veins, tho' his
being the Son of one of the greatest Kings that <i>Poland</i> ever had, as well
as his own Dignity of a Sovereign, ought to have procured him the Respect
of all the <i>Poles</i>, yet every Person and Thing belonging to him at
<i>Warsaw</i>, was maltreated. Such was, at that time, the unhappy Fate of
<i>Poland</i>; Oppression and Tyranny having succeeded the glorious, mild, and
peaceful Reign of <i>Augustus</i> II.</p>

<p>Mean time, those generous Noblemen who had so bravely stood up in the
defence of the Liberties and Honour of their Country, after having tried
all their Efforts to reclaim their wandering Brethren, found they could
not succeed, and therefore broke up; after which, they met in the very
same Place where <i>Henry de Valois</i> had been elected, and there they chose
and proclaim'd <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, King of <i>Poland</i>. They then
sent a Deputation to his Majesty, to intreat him to come immediately, with
the Queen his Consort, to take possession of the Throne. The King comply'd
with their Intreaty, and set out from <i>Dresden</i>, after having return'd
solemn Thanks to God, the sovereign Disposer of Crowns, and of the Fortune
of Kings.</p>

<p>In a few days the Queen followed the King, and overtook him at
<i>Tarnovitz</i>, where their Majesties received the grand Deputation from
<i>Poland</i>; and after giving them Audience, proceeded in their Journey
towards <i>Cracow</i>. There the King made his Royal Entry on the 14th of
<i>January</i> 1734, and on the 17th of that Month, their Majesties were
consecrated and crowned by <i>Lipsky</i> the Bishop of that See.</p>

<!--132.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after this august Ceremony, which, in <i>Poland</i>, is absolutely
necessary and essential for a King Elect, the Queen return'd to <i>Saxony</i>;
but the King staid at <i>Cracow</i>, where he held a Diet, in which he made
several Regulations for restoring the Tranquillity of the Kingdom. When
the Diet was ended, his Majesty march'd towards <i>Dantzic</i>, which the
<i>Russians</i>, his Allies, had invested, in order to drive out the Primate
and his Adherents, who were retir'd thither.</p>

<p>But after a March of several Days, which the Severity of the Weather
render'd very painful, his Majesty yielded to the Instances that were made
to him from <i>Saxony</i>, to assist in Person at the opening of the Assembly
of States which he was under a necessity of calling; and he returned to
<i>Dresden</i>, where his Arrival caus'd an inexpressible Joy. Mean time the
Army, under the Command of the Prince of <i>Saxe-Weissenfels</i> continued its
March towards <i>Dantzic</i>.</p>

<p>The King was accompanied by a great number of <i>Polish</i> Noblemen, who
finding themselves unable to oppose the Rage of the Primate's Party in
their several Countries, came to seek shelter in <i>Saxony</i>, where his
Majesty receiv'd them, and still entertains them, in a manner which cannot
but convince them of his Gratitude, and give them greater Hopes of what
Favours they may expect, when the Tranquillity of <i>Poland</i> is restor'd.</p>

<p>The King, after his Return from <i>Cracow</i>, summon'd the States of his
Electorate, and open'd the Assembly with the usual Ceremonies. He was
seated on his Throne, accompanied by the chief Lords of his Court, as well
the <i>Polish</i> as <i>Saxons</i>. M. <i>de Miltitz</i>, his Privy Counsellor, sat on
the Right-hand of the Throne; and, in the King's Name, made a Speech to
the States, wherein he declared to them that his Majesty intended to make
no
Innovation<!--133.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
in the Affairs of Religion, but to let his Protestant
Subjects enjoy their Privileges, as they had been granted and confirm'd to
them by the late King. Then they told him the Motives which had engag'd
the King to call them together, and demanded the necessary Subsidies for
defraying the extraordinary Expences which his Majesty had been
necessarily involved in thro' the Calamities of the Time. M. <i>de Hesler</i>,
Administrator of the Office of hereditary Marshal of <i>Saxony</i>, return'd an
Answer in the Name of the States, and spoke with a Dignity, and all the
Decorum due to so august an Assembly. He assur'd the King of the
respectful and inviolable Fidelity and Attachment of his Subjects to his
sacred Person. And in truth, 'tis impossible for a People to be better
affected to their Sovereign, and more disposed to contribute to every
thing that is capable of augmenting his Glory.</p>

<p>The King's voluntary Declaration to his States that he would make no
Innovation in the Affairs of Religion, won the Hearts of his Subjects to
such a degree, that there is not a <i>Saxon</i> who would make any scruple to
sacrifice his Life and Fortune for his Service. And the said Declaration
does equal Honour to the Justice of the Monarch, and the Wisdom of his
Ministers.</p>

<p>While the King was employ'd with his States in securing the Happiness and
Tranquility of <i>Saxony</i>, his Majesty received Advice, that his Army, after
having join'd the <i>Russians</i>, had obliged the <i>Dantzickers</i> to surrender,
and that the <i>Polish</i> Lords of the contrary Party petition'd for leave to
remove to some Place where they might pay him their homage. The King, in
imitation of the great Emperor whose Name he bears, after having made a
Conquest, thought, like him, of nothing more than to make those happy whom
the Fortune of War had submitted to his Arms. His Majesty did not take
<!--134.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>any
advantage of his Victory, but forgetting past Offences, repair'd to
the Abbey of <i>Oliva</i>, near <i>Dantzic</i>, where he receiv'd the Submission of
the <i>Dantzickers</i>, and the Allegiance of the Lords that were the Primate's
Adherents. By his Modesty and Goodness, he charm'd the Vanquished, and
convinc'd them of their Obligation to pay him that Esteem which before
perhaps they did not think was their Duty to grant to him. The Greatness
of his Soul, which inclines him to sympathize with the Misfortunes of the
Unhappy, hinder'd him from entering <i>Dantzic</i>, the desolate State of that
City being so afflicting a Scene to him, that he cou'd not bear to see it.
The <i>Dantzickers</i>, by their submission, were become his Subjects; their
present Misfortunes, and their past Mistakes, affected him to such a
degree, that he was fearful of being put in mind of them, and refus'd to
appear among them, crown'd with those Laurels which he had reap'd by their
defeat. So much Modesty, worthy of the most glorious Triumph, gain'd him
the Prayers of the People, in which his Majesty saw more Charms, than he
wou'd have found in Trophies, and the most stately Triumphal Arches.</p>

<p>The King having provided for the pressing Necessities of his Kingdom,
return'd to his Electorate, where the States continued their Deliberations
ever since his Absence. Now that his Majesty is return'd, the Care of the
State is almost his constant Employment. His Recreations are either taking
the Air on horseback, Hunting, the <i>Italian</i> Opera, or else going to
Concerts, which the Queen, who is a great Lover of Music, causes to be
perform'd in her own Apartment. Their Majesties generally dine together,
and admit the Nobility of both Sexes to their Table.</p>

<!--135.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>There, the King observes that Temperance which so much becomes sovereign
Princes. All his Hours, as has been already observ'd, are regulated; and
all his Actions accompanied with Devotion, good Order, and Equity. Never
did King better discharge that sacred Character; being always firm and
tranquil, Danger cou'd never affright him. He accepted the Crown, tho' he
saw he cou'd never fix it on his Head without infinite Pains, Peril, and
Cares. The Advantage he had gain'd over his Enemies did not seem to have
flush'd him; he was sorry he had not been able to reclaim them by gentle
Methods, and ascribes the happy Success of his Arms solely to Providence.</p>

<p>Thus have I given you a very imperfect Account of the Virtues and Actions
of a King, which plainly denote that the perfect honest Man (a Title not
unworthy even of the sacred Majesty of Kings) forms his Character. As for
his Stature, 'tis such as, one wou'd think, those ought to have who are
born to command. He has a robust and vigorous Constitution, a sound
Judgment, a happy Memory, a generous and beneficent Soul, the necessary
Constituents of the Hero and the Christian. His Conduct is regulated by a
great Attachment to the Principles of Religion. His Aim and his
Application are to render his Subjects happy; and he only longs for Peace
that they may taste the Fruits of it.</p>

<p>As to her <span class="smcap">Majesty</span> the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, the Name of that august Princess, whom Heaven
has endowed with all manner of Virtues, to be the worthy Wife of a King,
is <span class="smcap">Maria Josepha</span>, who was born the 8th of <i>December</i> 1699, and is the
eldest Daughter of <i>Joseph</i> Emperor of the <i>Romans</i>, and of
<i>Wilhelmina-Amelia</i> of <i>Brunswic-Lunenbourg-Hanover</i>. Her Marriage to the
King, then the Prince Royal, was celebrated at <i>Vienna</i>, the 20th of
<i>August</i>
1719,<!--136.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
betwixt 8 and 9 a Clock at Night, in the Chapel of the
Palace of the <i>Favorita</i>, by the Pope's Nuncio, who next day perform'd the
solemn Mass. In a few days after, this Princess set out with her Husband
for <i>Saxony</i>. It has already been observed with what Pomp she was received
by the King her Father-in-law; and the Veneration paid her by the
Subjects, was equal to the Magnificence of her Reception by the King. The
Returns that the Princess made on her part, manifested a Goodness which
nothing cou'd resist; so that she had the Homage and the Hearts both of
the Courtiers and the common People. Being the Daughter of a Princess,
whom the World respects even more for her Virtues than for the Splendour
of that extraordinary Grandeur with which she is inviron'd, her Royal
Highness's sole Concern was to walk in the Steps of that august Mother,
the Pattern of Princesses, and the Honour of Religion. She conceiv'd a
Respect for the King her Father-in-law, and the Queen her Mother-in-law,
from which she never departed; and now that she is a Sovereign, she has no
other Cares than to render a Nation happy which is worthy of being so for
its Affection and Fidelity to its Electors. She is inviolably attach'd to
her Duties, full of Tenderness and Respect for her Husband, and always
wisely employ'd in what may procure him solid Comfort. She continually
gives him Examples of Piety and Charity; she is beneficent to all that
make their Necessities known to her, and seems to think every unfortunate
Subject merits her Protection. The Care she takes of her Children is not
only the Care of a tender Mother, but of a Queen, who, in love to the
State, is desirous to form their Minds, so as to render them worthy of
being its Sovereigns, and to procure them the advantage of being more
respected, if possible, for their Virtues than their Birth.</p>

<!--137.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen, who went with the King to <i>Cracow</i>, and there receiv'd the
Crown, return'd after her Coronation to <i>Saxony</i>, where she is belov'd and
reverenc'd by People of all Ranks. This august Princess seems to have an
Air of Gravity, as have all the Princes of the most serene House of
<i>Austria</i>; but as she is serious, so she is discreet, modest, and
good-natur'd. She was educated, as are all the Archdutchesses, in the
knowledge of Things useful for those who are born to govern States; she
speaks several Languages very readily, and particularly the <i>Latin</i>, in
such a manner as both charms and surprizes the <i>Poles</i>. She is Mistress of
History and Geography, and has a solid Taste of Musick, Painting, and all
the Sciences in general: Yet never did Queen take less Pride in her
Talents; for, by kindly condescending to accommodate her self to the
Capacities of those with whom she converses, she conceals all her
Superiority. Her high Rank serves only to render her affable; she is the
Mother of the People, and particularly of the Poor. And to sum up the
Character of this great Princess, it may be said in short, that she is a
virtuous Wife, a faithful Companion, a tender Mother, and a compassionate
Sovereign.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the <span class="smcap">Prince Royal</span> and <span class="smcap">Electoral</span> was born at <i>Dresden</i>,
the 5th of <i>September</i> 1722, and baptized in the <i>Roman</i> Catholick Church,
by the Name of <i>Frederic-Christian</i>: He is handsome, and has a Countenance
full of Good-nature, and indeed his Goodness charms all that pay their
court to him. His Knowledge and Learning are beyond one of his tender
Years; he talks several Languages justly, and with ease; and his strong
Inclination to follow the wise Counsels of his Governor, the Count
<i>Gabaleon-Wackerbarth-Salmour</i>, is a sure Presage that when he comes to
the Age of Maturity, he will walk in the glorious Steps of the King his
Father.</p>

<!--138.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>As to their Royal Highnesses the other Princes, the eldest of them, Prince
<span class="smcap">Augustus-Albert-Christian-Xavier</span> was born the 25th of <i>August</i> 1730. He is
handsome, full of Life and Spirit, and already discovers a great
Inclination to every thing military. He is infinitely better pleased to
see the Officers of his Regiment about him than the Women his Attendants.
The Noise of Drums and Trumpets is the most agreeable Music to him, and
according to all appearance, 'tis what he will always prefer to the Flute.
When he went with their Majesties to <i>Cracow</i>, and heard talk of the
Ravages committed by the Palatine of <i>Kiow</i>, he said, he had a mind to go
and fight him, and cut off his Head. In fine, all the Actions of this
young Prince give hopes that he will add one to the Number of Heroes
descended from the august Blood of <i>Saxony</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles-Christian-Joseph</span> came into the World <i>July</i> 13, 1733, so that his
Royal Highness is too young as yet for any Character in History; and I
shall proceed next to their Royal Highnesses the Princesses.</p>

<p>Her Royal Highness <span class="smcap">Mary-Amelia</span>, their Majesties eldest Daughter, was born
at <i>Dresden</i>, the 24th of <i>September</i> 1724. She is fair, very well shap'd,
and has the Air of her Mother. Her Features are regular, and 'tis heartily
to be wish'd that the Small-Pox may spare them. The Care the Queen takes
of her Education is so well bestow'd on her, that she is much better
form'd than Princesses of her Age generally are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary-Anne-Sophia</span> was born the 24th of <i>August</i> 1728. She is brown, and
likely to be much admir'd for her Beauty. There is something in her
Physiognomy so subtle and witty, that she has already secur'd the
Suffrages of the Courtiers.</p>

<!--139.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess <span class="smcap">Mary-Josepha</span> was born the 4th of <i>November</i> 1731. Heaven has
been pleas'd to grant her a share of Beauty with all the Princes and
Princesses her Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p>I should make some mention of all the <span class="smcap">Princes</span> and <span class="smcap">Princesses</span> of the <span class="smcap">Blood</span>,
<i>viz.</i> all the most serene Dukes, Princes and Princesses of the Family of
<i>Saxony</i>, particularly those who are deriv'd from the <i>Albertine</i> Branch,
as descending with the King from the Elector <i>John-George</i> I. who form'd
the four Branches, <i>viz.</i> the Electoral Branch, and those of
<i>Weissenfels</i>, <i>Mersbourg</i>, and <i>Zeits</i>. But as this is only an Epitome of
<i>Augustus</i> III's Court, I shall only take notice of those Princes who
reside there; <i>viz.</i> <span class="smcap">John-Adolphus</span> Duke of <span class="smcap">Saxe-Weissenfels</span>, and the
Princess <span class="smcap">Christina</span> of <span class="smcap">Saxe-Weissenfels</span>.</p>

<p>The Duke, who was born <i>September</i> 4, 1685, is of a good Stature. His Air,
Behaviour, and way of thinking, denote his Birth; and never was Prince
more worthy of being so. He is beneficent, generous; and all the Qualities
which attract Love and Esteem are united in his Person. After having spent
his early Days in the Service of <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>, he enter'd into that of
the late King; and in the several Campaigns which he made in <i>Germany</i>,
<i>Italy</i>, <i>Flanders</i>, and <i>Poland</i>, he always signaliz'd his Valour; and
particularly not long ago, when he supported the Reputation of the King's
Arms before <i>Dantzic</i> in a conspicuous manner. His Goodness, his Modesty,
and his Care to distinguish true Merit, gain him the Love and Veneration
both of the Officers and Soldiers. This Prince is actually a
Lieutenant-General in the Emperor's Army, General of the <i>Saxon</i> Horse and
Foot, Colonel of the Life-Guards, and of a Regiment of Foot, and Knight of
the Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>.
He<!--140.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
is the Widower of <i>Caroline</i> Princess
of <i>Saxe-Eysenach</i>, and professes the <i>Lutheran</i> Religion.</p>

<p>The Princess <span class="smcap">Christina</span> of <span class="smcap">Saxe-Weissenfels</span>, who was born the 27th of
<i>July</i> 1690, adheres to the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Doctrine, Prince <i>Albert</i> her
Father being a Convert to that Communion. She is of a good Stature, has a
grand Majestic Air, and her Behaviour is graceful and polite. Her most
serene Highness receives all that draw near to her with Respect and
Kindness, and demonstrates her high Birth only by discharging the
Obligations of it. She is so firmly attach'd to the Queen by the Bands of
Love and Virtue that she is caress'd and distinguish'd by her; and all the
Court honours and respects her more out of Inclination than Duty.</p>

<p>You will not perhaps be sorry to know the Names, <i>&amp;c.</i> of the late King's
legitimated Natural Issue, who are rank'd immediately after the Princes of
the Blood. They are four Sons and three Daughters, of whom I shall now
give you an Account, and who were their Mothers.</p>

<p>1. Count <i>Maurice</i> of <i>Saxony</i> is the eldest of the late King's Natural
Children, by <i>Aurora</i> Countess of <i>Koningsmark</i>, the most worthy of her
Sex in <i>Europe</i> to be the Mistress of a great King; and of all the King's
Favourite Ladies, she kept longest in his Favour, so that after her
Retirement she acquitted her self so well that she continued in the
possession of his Majesty's Esteem and Regard. She is still living, and
after having been a Prioress of the Imperial <i>Lutheran</i> Abbey
<i>Quedlinbourg</i> she rose to be the Abbess. The Count is a
Lieutenant-General, and Colonel of a Regiment of Foot in <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>2. The next is the Count <i>Rotofski</i> or <i>Rutowski</i>, Lieutenant-General, and
Colonel of the Crown-Guards, who owes his Birth to the King's tender
Passion for <i>Fatima</i> a <i>Turkish</i> Lady who was taken Prisoner
very<!--141.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
young,
and fell to the share of M. <i>Schoning</i>, a Lieutenant-General in the
Service of the Elector of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, who carried her to <i>Berlin</i>, and
had her baptiz'd without altering her Name, tho' she afterwards went by
that of Madame <i>de Spiegel</i>. Madamoiselle <i>de Flemming</i>, known by the Name
of <i>Brebentau</i>, having married the Palatine of that Name, took a fancy to
her, obtain'd her of M. <i>de Schoning</i>, and carried her with her into
<i>Poland</i>, where from a Slave she became the King's Mistress, tho' Madame
<i>Brebentau</i> did not perceive it till <i>Fatima</i>'s Waist betray'd her. She
had as much Wit as Beauty, and every body said she deserv'd her Fortune.
Nevertheless, she did not enjoy it long; for Madame <i>de Lubomirski</i>, who
was Wife to the Great Chamberlain of the Crown, stole away the King's
Heart from her. The Count <i>Rutowski</i> is a Major-General of the King's
Forces, Colonel of the Life-Guards, and of a Regiment of Foot, and Knight
of the Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>. This Nobleman very much resembles the
late King his Father, having his Strength, Dexterity, Valour and
Politeness. He had his Education in <i>France</i>, and from thence went into
the <i>Service</i> of <i>Victor Amadeus</i> the late King of <i>Sardinia</i>. Then he
enter'd for a little while into the Service of the King of <i>Prussia</i>, and
at length fix'd himself in that of <i>Saxony</i>, when he signaliz'd his Valour
at the Siege of <i>Dantzic</i>, and afterwards made the Campaign as a Voluntier
in the Imperial Army on the <i>Rhine</i>. As for his Religion, he professes the
<i>Roman</i> Catholic.</p>

<p>3. The third of the late King's Natural Sons is <i>George</i> Prince <i>de
Teschen</i>, otherwise call'd the <i>Chevalier de Saxony</i>, whom he had by
Madame <i>de Lubomirski</i> above-mentioned, who was Niece to the famous
Cardinal <i>Radjouski</i> Archbishop of <i>Gnesna</i>, and Primate of <i>Poland</i>.
After this Lady had indulg'd the King's Passion she got a Divorce from
<!--142.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>Prince
<i>Lubomirski</i>, and took the Title of the Princess <i>de Teschen</i>,
which was granted to her by the Emperor. This Son of her's was brought up
in the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Religion. He is a Colonel in the King's Service,
and Knight of the Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>. He is a well-set Man, has a
noble Air, and supports his Title by a great share of Valour and good
Sense. He is perfect Master of military Architecture, and has great
Talents for War, which he cultivates to such a degree that his very
Amusements are the Study of what a great Captain ought to know. This
Desire of his to be qualify'd some day or other for the Command of an Army
engag'd him, at his return from the Siege of <i>Dantzic</i>, to repair to the
Army of Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i> to improve himself in the Art of War
under that Great Master.</p>

<p>4. The fourth and youngest of the Natural Sons of the late King of
<i>Poland</i> is the Count <i>de Cosel</i>, Knight of the Order of the <i>White
Eagle</i>, whose Mother was the Countess <i>de Cosel</i>; which Lady is also
Mother to the Countesses of <i>Friesland</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and <i>Moschinski</i><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. The
Count is a tall handsome Youth, modest and reserv'd, and more prudent than
might be expected from his Years. This Nobleman, who does not disparage
his Birth, is now making the Campaign upon the <i>Rhine</i> in the Imperial
Army. He is of the <i>Lutheran</i> Communion.</p>

<p>Madame <i>de Cosel</i> is of the Family of <i>Bruchstorf</i>, and a Native of
<i>Holstein</i>. She was Maid of Honour to the Dutchess of <i>Wolfembuttle</i>, when
the Count <i>de Hoym</i> Minister of State to the King of <i>Poland</i> married her:
The Count soon after the Marriage carried her to <i>Dresden</i>, where the King
fell
in<!--143.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
love with her, and no sooner made it known to her but gain'd her
compliance. M. <i>de Hoym</i> enrag'd at this, demanded a Divorce from her,
which his Wife readily came into; so that the Consistory of <i>Dresden</i>
declared their Marriage null and void. M. <i>de Hoym</i> married again, and
Madame took the Title of the Countess <i>de Cosel</i>; but this Lady at once
lost the King's Favour and her Liberty into the bargain, and is kept close
Prisoner in a Castle, where she has nothing to do but to indulge her
melancholy Reflections upon the Revolutions of her Fortune<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Natural Daughters</span> of the late King are, 1. The Countess of <i>Bilinski</i>,
(Sister of the Count <i>Rutowski</i>) who was born in <i>Poland</i> as well as her
Brother, and educated in the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Religion. <i>Augustus</i> II.
gave her in Marriage to the Count <i>Bilinski</i>. The Countess's frequent
Ailments obliged her to go to <i>Paris</i> for her Health; so that not being of
this Court, 'twill not be expected I should give her Character.</p>

<!--144.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>2. The Countess of <i>Orselska</i>, who was born at <i>Warsaw</i>, of one <i>Renard</i> a
<i>French</i> Woman, and bred up in the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Faith: She is of a
good Stature, and very charming. Of all the late King's legitimated
Children his Majesty seem'd to be fondest of this. She was at first very
much neglected, and it did not appear that the King ever intended to own
her. But Count <i>Rotofski</i> seeing her at <i>Warsaw</i> in a Plight too mean for
her Birth took the freedom to mention her to the King her Father, and told
him that she merited some Kindness from him. The King thereupon desir'd to
see her, and she came into his Presence in the <i>Amazonian</i> Habit, which
was her favourite Dress. The King thought she resembled him very much, and
not being able to resist the tender Impressions of Nature he embrac'd her,
and call'd her his Daughter. At the same time he order'd the whole Court
to acknowledge her in that Quality, gave her a magnificent Palace, with
Diamonds without number, and settled great Pensions on her. 'Tis certain,
in short, that never was Daughter more like her Father; she had the same
Features, Temper and Genius. It was impossible for her to be handsomer
with a more grand Air. She is fond of Magnificence, Expence, and
Pleasures. One of her Diversions is to dress in Mens Apparel. It was in
this Habit that I saw her the first time, when she was on horseback, in a
purple Habit embroider'd with Silver, and wore the blue Ribband of
<i>Poland</i>. Being all alone, I could not learn who she was, but really took
her to be some young Foreign Nobleman whom I had not yet seen. I never
beheld any body sit better than she did on horseback, or have a more
amiable Air; insomuch, that many Ladies would have been glad of a Lover so
handsome. The same evening I saw her at the Ball, where she was still
dress'd like a Man, only her Habit was more rich than it was in the
morning,<!--145.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and her dishevell'd Locks of Hair hung down in fine Curls about
her Shoulders; so that <i>Cupid</i> himself was not more tempting when he
appear'd before <i>Psyche</i>. Her good Mien, and the graceful Air with which I
saw her dance a Minuet, made me inquire who this pretty Youth was? Count
<i>Rotofski</i>, who overheard me, made answer, <i>The young Man whom you admire
wou'd do you no great harm if you were a Woman, but may possibly hurt you
as the Case stands; but come along with me</i>, continued he, taking me by
the Hand, <i>I will make him known to you, then leave you to come off with
him as well as you can</i>. I guess'd by these Words that the Person he was
going to usher me to was the Countess <i>Orselska</i>; and I was confirmed in
my Suspicion when I heard Count <i>Rotofski</i> say to her, <i>Sister, here is a
Gentleman who has all due Respects for you, and who, I'll engage will be
ready to serve you in whatever you shall require of him</i>. Madamoiselle
<i>Orselska</i> smiling at this Discourse, I saluted her with all the Respect
which I ow'd to her Rank, and she receiv'd me in the most obliging manner
possible. I saw her next day in Womens Apparel, and thought her still more
amiable. I visit her every day, and now whenever I go to her I generally
find with her <i>Charles Lewis</i>, a younger Prince of the Family of
<i>Holstein-Beck</i>, who 'tis said is the happy Man for whom she is design'd
in Marriage<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

<p>3. The Countess <i>Moschinski</i>, Daughter of the Countess of <i>Cosel</i>, was
born at <i>Dresden</i>, and match'd by the late King to the Count <i>de
Moschinski</i>, a <i>Polish</i> Nobleman. Her sober and courteous
Deportment,<!--146.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
and
the Goodness of her Temper, have procured her both Love and Reverence.</p>

<p>Having now treated of the Princes of the Royal Family, I proceed to give
you an account of the chief Noblemen of the Court; and in the first place,
of the <span class="smcap">Ministers</span> of the <span class="smcap">Cabinet</span>.&mdash;These are, 1. <i>Waldemar</i> Baron <i>de
Lowendahl</i> Grand Marshal, Knight of the <i>Saxon</i> Order of the <i>White
Eagle</i>, and of the <i>Danish</i> Order of the <i>Elephant</i>, who by his Post of
Grand Marshal holds the first Rank at the Court of <i>Saxony</i>, because the
Elector is Arch Grand Marshal of the Empire. He is a <i>Dane</i> by birth, and
is descended from a Count of <i>Guldenlowe</i>, a natural Son of the
Blood-Royal of <i>Denmark</i>. He spent his youthful Days in the Service of the
<i>States-General</i>, and was made a Captain in the Blue Guards; which he
afterwards quitted, and went into the Service of the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>,
and distinguish'd himself in quality of a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1683, at
the raising of the Siege of <i>Vienna</i>; after which he return'd to
<i>Denmark</i>, where he serv'd with Honour. But leaving that Court upon some
Disgust, he came into <i>Saxony</i>, where <i>Augustus</i> II. declared him
President of the Chamber, which Office he held when the King of <i>Denmark</i>
recall'd him home. It was with the Approbation of his Master the King of
<i>Poland</i> that he return'd to <i>Copenhagen</i>, where his <i>Danish</i> Majesty gave
him the Command of his Army in <i>Norway</i> against the <i>Swedes</i>; which
Commission he discharged with so much Honour, that he was dignify'd with
the Order of the <i>Elephant</i>, as he had already been by that of
<i>Dannebroc</i>. He might, had he pleased, have enjoy'd the greatest Offices
in <i>Denmark</i>; but he had promised <i>Augustus</i> II. not to forsake him, so
that he refus'd all the Advantages which <i>Frederic</i> IV. offer'd him, and
return'd into <i>Saxony</i>. After the death of the Count <i>de Phlug</i>, the late
King appointed him Grand Marshal, which Office he
still<!--147.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
executes with
Honour. Tho' he is now advanced in years he has a sound Constitution, and
the Air, Behaviour, and Way of Thinking of a Man of his Quality. Being
affable and polite, he does the Honours of the Court in a Gentleman-like
manner, for which the Courtiers reverence him, and the King professes an
esteem for him. His Majesty is the sixth King whom this Minister has
serv'd. He has married to his second Wife a Lady of the Family of
<i>Rantzau</i>, in the Country of <i>Holstein</i>, who bears a valuable Character,
and is as polite as can be desired, speaking <i>French</i> as well as if she
was born at <i>Versailles</i>. The Grand Marshal has two Sons by his first
Marriage with a Lady of <i>Revenclau</i>: his youngest, <i>viz.</i> <i>Woldemar</i> Baron
<i>de Lowendahl</i> is Major-General of the King's Armies, Inspector General of
the <i>Saxon</i> Infantry, and Colonel of a Regiment of Foot. He was fourteen
years old when the Grand Marshal sent him to <i>Denmark</i>; where he made a
Campaign at Sea under Admiral <i>Tordenschild</i>. At his return to <i>Dresden</i>
he carried a Musket, and afterwards pass'd through all the subaltern
Degrees. When he was but a Lieutenant he accompany'd General <i>Seckendorf</i>
to <i>Vienna</i>, where the Marshal Count <i>Guido de Staremberg</i> gave him a
Company in his Regiment, and he distinguish'd himself in a particular
manner at the Sieges of <i>Temiswaer</i> and <i>Belgrade</i>, and in <i>Sicily</i>. Since
that, he enter'd into the Service of <i>Augustus</i> II. who gave him a
Regiment. Afterwards he made two Campaigns as a Voluntier with the
Imperialists in <i>Corsica</i>; and upon all occasions manifested that Valour,
Skill, and Prudence, as he did lately in the Defence of <i>Cracow</i>; where,
with a weak and sickly Garrison, he not only made a vigorous stand against
the Attacks of the Primate's <i>Polish</i> Adherents, but also obliged them to
retire. This General is so fond of signalizing his Bravery, that he was
scarce return'd from
<i>Poland</i>,<!--148.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
but he went to make the Campaign as a
Voluntier, with the Imperial Army on the <i>Rhine</i>. He lives magnificently,
keeps a good Table, and is very civil to Foreigners.</p>

<p>2. <i>Anthony</i> Count de <i>Lutzelbourg</i>, who is by birth a <i>Lorrainer</i>, and an
exemplary Professor of the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Religion, is
Lieutenant-General of the Forces, Knight of the Order of the White Eagle,
and General of the Horse. He is pretty tall, and has a chearful
Countenance, with a noble easy Behaviour, which shews the Man of Quality.
His Merit procured him the Honour of being the King's Governour after the
Decease of the Count <i>de Costa</i>, which Post he held 'till his Majesty came
of age, when he was appointed Steward of his Houshold, and was as much
esteem'd by their Royal Highnesses as he is valued by the Courtiers, and
belov'd by the Domestics of the Prince who are under his command: but his
frequent Ailments oblig'd him to quit that Office: Nevertheless he was
last year at <i>Vienna</i>, where he receiv'd for the King his Master the
Investiture of the Feudatory States of the Empire, and concluded the
Treaty of Alliance still subsisting between the two Courts.</p>

<p>3. <i>Henry-Frederic</i> Count of <i>Friesland</i>, is Great Chamberlain, General of
the Infantry, Lieutenant-General of the King's Forces, and Knight of the
Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>. He is descended from a Family which has for a
long time been of illustrious Rank in <i>Saxony</i>. He spent part of his Youth
in the Service of <i>Peter</i> the Great, Czar of <i>Muscovy</i>, and signaliz'd his
Valour very much at the Battle of <i>Pultowa</i>; where <i>Charles</i> XII. King of
<i>Sweden</i> in a few Hours lost all the fruit of nine years Toil, and of an
infinite number of Victories. Soon after this great Battle he shew'd his
Wisdom to be equal to his Bravery at the Battle of <i>Pruth</i>; which though
it did not turn out so much to the Czar's
Honour,<!--149.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
was altogether as
fortunate to him, since it extricated that Prince out of the worst scrape
that perhaps ever King was reduced to. He enter'd afterwards into the
Service of the late King; who being sensible of his Merit, raised him to
the greatest Dignities of his Court, and married him to one of the
Daughters that he had by the Countess of <i>Cosel</i>. The Great Chamberlain,
who has the Looks and Behaviour of a Man of Quality, thinks and acts too
like a Nobleman. Few Persons surpass him in Politeness and Learning: He is
perfect Master of several Languages, and of every thing that forms the
Minister and the General. He loves Literature and the Arts, and was always
their Supporter. He lives handsomely, and has such a Presence as commands
the Veneration of all that have to do with him.</p>

<p>4. <i>Joseph</i> Count <i>de Gabaleon-Wackerbarth-Salmour</i>, the adopted Son of
the Velt-Marshal <i>Augustus Christopher</i> Count <i>de Wackerbarth</i> who
succeeded Marshal <i>de Flemming</i> in the chief command of the Troops in
<i>Saxony</i>, and was not only Marshal, but a Minister of State, Grand Master
of the Artillery, Governour of <i>Dresden</i>, and Knight of the Order of the
<i>White Eagle</i>. The Father was born of a good Family in <i>Mecklembourg</i>; but
from his very youth he attach'd himself to the Elector of <i>Saxony</i>; and by
his own Merit, and the Friendship of his Predecessor Count <i>Flemming</i>, he
was raised to the chief Posts in the Army and the Court. In 1709 he had
the Command of the <i>Saxon</i> Troops before <i>Tournay</i>, as he had in 1715
before <i>Strahlsund</i>, when 'twas besieg'd by the Kings of <i>Denmark</i> and
<i>Prussia</i>, and defended by <i>Charles</i> XII. King of <i>Sweden</i>. M. <i>de
Wackerbarth</i> was made Count of the Empire by the King his Master, while
that Prince was Vicar of the Empire, after the death of the Emperor
<i>Joseph</i>. After being grac'd with this
Dignity,<!--150.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the Count <i>de
Wackerbarth</i> was employ'd in sundry important Negotiations, especially at
<i>Vienna</i>; where he married a <i>Piedmontese</i> Lady, the Dowager of <i>Charles</i>
Margrave of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, Brother to <i>Frederic</i> I. King of <i>Prussia</i>,
who when he was but very young at the University of <i>Turin</i>; married her
by the Left-hand, as you know is the Fashion among our Princes when they
marry below themselves. However the Lady went by the Name of Madame <i>de
Brandenbourg</i> to the very day that the Count <i>de Wackerbarth</i> married her,
being so proud of the Title that she was resolv'd never to part with it
'till she was married again: Notwithstanding the advantageous Offers made
to her from the King of <i>Prussia</i> to engage her to renounce it, her
refusal of which was the more generous because it was at a time too when
she was in narrow Circumstances; yet her constant Answer was, that nothing
in the Universe should tempt her to debase herself; and that she had
rather be poor, and pass for the Wife of the Margrave of <i>Brandenbourg</i>,
than be rich, and pass for his Mistress. Before she became Madame <i>de
Brandenbourg</i> she was the Widow of a certain Count <i>de Salmour</i>, by whom
she had a Son whom she engaged the Count <i>de Wackerbarth</i>, when she
married him, to adopt for his own. I confess I never saw this Lady; for at
the time of my former Voyage hither she was at <i>Vienna</i>; and now she is
dead. They talk of her still as one of the acutest Women of her time. But
to return to the Marshal; he is very civil, lives with great Splendor, and
his House is open to all Foreigners. He is mighty intimate with the Count
<i>de Flemming</i>, Prime Minister and Favourite of the King; so that they
fully contradicted the Proverb, <i>That Fire and Water can't agree</i>; for
Count <i>Flemming</i> was lively almost to the Degree of a Fury, whereas the
Count <i>de Wackerbarth</i>, on the
contrary,<!--151.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
abounds with Phlegm<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. We go
back now to his adopted Son <i>Joseph</i> above-mention'd, a <i>Piedmontese</i>, at
present one of the Ministers of the Cabinet<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>He is also Knight of the Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>, and Governour of his
Royal Highness the Prince Royal and Electoral. He bears the Name and Arms
of <i>Wackerbarth</i>, by reason of his being adopted as above by the
Velt-Marshal his Father-in-law; upon whose death, he succeeded to his
Estate. He took to arms betimes; but having receiv'd a Wound in the Foot,
which he feels to this day, he was oblig'd to quit a Profession in which
he distinguish'd himself, and apply'd afterwards to Affairs of State. The
late King sent him to the Courts of <i>Bavaria</i> and <i>Vienna</i>, where he
supported the Prerogatives of his Character with Dignity, and gain'd the
extraordinary Esteem of their Imperial Majesties and the Ministers.
<i>Augustus</i> II. recall'd him from <i>Vienna</i>, and sent him to <i>Rome</i>, to the
new Pope <i>Clement</i> XII. The <i>Romans</i>, those Masters in the Art of
Politics, were soon convinced that this Minister knew more than they could
teach him: They admired the Prudence and Resolution with which he behav'd
when the <i>Sbirri</i> presum'd to invade the Franchise of his Quarter; and all
own'd that the most experienced Minister could not have better supported
the Honour of his Master. At his Return from <i>Rome</i>, the late King, to the
Satisfaction of all Men, appointed him Governour to Prince <i>Frederic</i>, the
present Prince Royal and Electoral; the Count having all the necessary
Qualifications to fill that Post with Honour: For besides
a<!--152.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
good Share of
Religion, he is a Gentleman of known Candour, great Experience in
Business, and abundance of Good-nature, Politeness, and Modesty: And he is
not only deeply learn'd, but always studious how to answer the great Trust
repos'd in him by their Majesties; and as the Method he takes to instruct
the Prince has won him his Royal Highness's Esteem and Friendship, so it
cannot fail of procuring him one day the Praise and Gratitude of those who
are concern'd for the Glory of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>When <i>Augustus</i> III. came to the Government he sent the Count, with M. <i>de
Baudissin</i>, in Quality of his Plenipotentiaries, to the Republic of
<i>Poland</i>; in which Post he answer'd the Expectation which the King had of
his Capacity. His Wisdom got the better of all Opposition; and he had the
advantage of triumphing over the Intrigues and Cabals of the Primate.
After the King had been proclaim'd the Count swore, in his Majesty's Name,
in the Church at <i>Warsaw</i>, to the Observation of the <i>Pacta Conventa</i>
drawn up by the Members of the Republic; and then accompanied the Grand
Deputation of the <i>Polish</i> Nobility at <i>Tarnowitz</i>. 'Twas he that made
answer, in the Name of their Majesties, to the Harangues of the Bishop of
<i>Cracow</i> declaring the Republic's Acknowledgement of his Title, and their
Obedience. And the Answer he return'd was in the two Languages in which
the Prelate address'd him: He spoke in <i>Latin</i> for the King, and in
<i>French</i> for the Queen.</p>

<p>The Count being return'd to <i>Dresden</i> since their Majesties Coronation, is
wholly taken up in the Education of the Prince Royal; and his care of him
has been crown'd with such Success, that we may prophesy his Royal
Highness will one day draw down that Blessing of God upon himself, which
is upon the Head of the Just.</p>

<!--153.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>Wolff-Henry de Baudissin</i>, General of the Horse, Colonel of a Regiment
of Carabiniers, and Knight of the Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>, and that of
<i>Dannebroc</i>, has all the Qualities requisite for a well-born Gentleman,
<i>viz.</i> an agreeable Aspect, a good Stature, a noble Air, easy and engaging
Behaviour, approv'd Valour, a Generosity free of all Ostentation; and
finally what is superior to all these Qualities, he has a Fund of Probity
and Candour which nothing can corrupt. He is a Native of <i>Holstein</i>, and
spent his early Years in the Service of <i>Sweden</i>, and afterwards in that
of the Duke his Sovereign, who gave him a Regiment, with which he serv'd
all the last War in the <i>Netherlands</i>, in the Post of Major-General.
<i>Augustus</i> II. calling him to his Service, made him Lieutenant-General of
his Forces, and then General of the Cavalry. When <i>Augustus</i> III. came to
the Government he summon'd him to his Cabinet-Council, and sent him as his
Plenipotentiary to <i>Poland</i>, where he had a hand in every Transaction for
the Advantage and Honour of the King. He afterwards commanded the Army
which his Majesty was obliged to carry into his Kingdom for the Defence of
his oppressed Subjects; and there he fell so dangerously ill that he was
obliged to return to <i>Germany</i>, to make use of the Waters of <i>Pyrmont</i>; by
which he found benefit; and he is now at <i>Dresden</i>, where his Seniority
gives him the Command in chief of the Forces.</p>

<p>6. <i>Alexander-Joseph</i> Count <i>de Sulkowski</i>, Starost of <i>Sokolnick</i>, Chief
Huntsman of <i>Lithuania</i>, Master of the Horse, Great Master of the
Wardrobe, Major-General of the King's Forces, Colonel of the Crown-Guards
and of a Regiment of Foot, and Knight of the Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>,
is a <i>Polander</i>. Being taken into Service very young as Page to the King,
then Prince Royal and Electoral, he accompanied him in his Travels, and
there<!--154.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
acquir'd a good Fund of Knowledge. His great Sobriety, his
Assiduity, his Application to the discharge of his Duties, his Sense, and
his sincere Attachment to Religion, won his Master's Heart, of which he
keeps possession even to this day; with a Distinction that does him the
more Honour, because he derives it from the King's thorough conviction of
his Merit.</p>

<p>The Count is of a good Stature, has a noble and modest Air, and a Candour
in his Conversation and his Action, which is very engaging. He is civil,
and makes no other Use of his Favour but to do as much Good as he can,
without prejudicing the Interests of the King whom he serves with
Gratitude, Affection, and Zeal. He is a generous Minister, and his House
is open to all Persons of Distinction.</p>

<p>After he had serv'd as a Page, he was by the late King made a Gentleman of
the Bed-Chamber; and not long after that, his present Majesty, who was
then still Prince Royal, declar'd him Director of his Hunting Equipage,
and trusted him with the Management of his Domestic Affairs. The late King
also appointed him one of his Chamberlains.</p>

<p>At the famous Camp at <i>Zeithaim</i>, the Count commanded an Independent
Company. He discover'd so great Application, and such a happy Genius for
the Art of War, that the late King, whose Penetration nothing cou'd
escape, took it for a good Omen, and gave him a Regiment of Foot. Thus did
the Count make his way towards the splendid Fortune which he now enjoys.
M. <i>de Bruhl</i> resigning his Post of Great Master of the Wardrobe, soon
after the King's Accession to the Government, his Majesty gave that Post
to his Favourite. He afterwards call'd him to his Cabinet-Council; and at
his Coronation, he made him Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. After
the Court's
Return<!--155.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
from <i>Cracow</i>, the Count went to the Army before
<i>Dantzic</i>; where he gave demonstration of his being as good a Soldier as
he is an able Statesman. It being not compatible with his Ministry to be
long absent, and <i>Dantzic</i> being on the point of capitulating, he went to
give the King an account of the Success of its Siege, and the Prosperity
of his Arms. He accompanied his Majesty to the Abbey of <i>Oliva</i>, and by
his Prudence contributed very much to put such <i>Polish</i> Lords in mind of
their Obedience, who had thought of being exempted from it. And his only
View being more and more to deserve that Favour with which the King
honours him, and being desirous of having it in his power to serve him, as
well in his Armies, as in his Cabinet, he went last of all to the Imperial
Army, in order to qualify himself for a Command under Prince <i>Eugene</i> of
<i>Savoy</i>.</p>

<p>To complete the good Fortune of this Count, he married a Lady, who,
besides her Birth and personal Charms, has a Character which gains her the
Applause and Veneration of all that know her. She is hereditary Baroness
of <i>Stein</i>; and when he marry'd her, she was Lady of Honour to the Queen.
They are both Members of the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Church.</p>

<p>7. <i>Henry de Bruhl</i>, Knight of the Orders of <i>Poland</i> and <i>Prussia</i>, a
Member of the Privy-Council, President of the Chamber of Finances,
Director General of the Excise, and Vice-President of the Taxes, is the
Son of <i>John de Bruhl</i>, who was of the Privy-Council to <i>Augustus</i> II. and
Grand Marshal and Director of the Privy-Council to the Duke Regent of
<i>Saxe-Weissenfels</i>. He is by Birth a <i>Saxon</i>, and has a Brother who is
Knight of the Teutonick Order. He made great progress at <i>Leipsic</i> in the
<i>Belles Lettres</i>, and in the Exercises suitable to a Person of his
Extraction. His
Recreations<!--156.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
there, were Music, and Conversation with
Persons of his own Taste. He sometimes made Verses, which were esteem'd
for the bright Thoughts in them, and the Harmony of the Versification.
When he quitted <i>Leipsic</i>, he was enter'd Page to the late King: In this
Post he behaved with so much Sobriety and Assiduity, that his Majesty soon
distinguish'd him from the Croud, admitted him to Familiarity with him;
and finding he had a sound Judgment, a quick Apprehension, a Penetration
beyond what might be expected from one of his Age, and that he was a
Person of Discretion, and inviolable Secrecy, join'd with a noble Freedom,
and such a happy way of expressing himself as to render the most difficult
Subjects easy and pleasant; he readily judg'd that such a one was fit to
be employ'd in great Affairs. He had a mind to instruct him; and having
nominated him one of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, he had him under
his Eye. M. <i>de Bruhl</i> improv'd so well from the Lessons of this great
Master, so thoroughly study'd his Humour, and so exactly suited himself to
his Genius, that he made himself necessary. His Application, his Love to
Business, and the Ease with which he dispatch'd it, won him the intire
Confidence of <i>Augustus</i> II. who declar'd him Great Master of the
Wardrobe, and a Privy Counsellor; and to him he moreover committed the
Direction and Regulation of Affairs, Foreign and Domestic. Never had the
King shewn more Affection or Esteem for any of his Favourites; yet this
Nobleman took ne'er the more State upon him for it, but living always
humble, polite, and ready to do Services, he made himself Friends, and
secur'd himself by that means against all the Hatred and Envy with which
Courtiers are very ready to treat those who are in Power.</p>

<!--157.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>When the King of <i>Prussia</i> went to the Camp at <i>Zeithaim</i>, he conferr'd
his Order of the Black Eagle upon M. <i>de Bruhl</i>: The late King also
honour'd him with that of the White Eagle; but this was at a time when
this Minister had no Relish for Honours, and wou'd have been glad to have
renounc'd them for ever, if he cou'd thereby have prolong'd the Days of a
Master so worthy of Immortality.</p>

<p>It was in those last Moments, when the Professions of Friendship cannot be
so much as suspected, that <i>Augustus</i> II. gave his Favourite his Order, as
a certain Token that he retain'd a value for him even to Death. This great
King having finish'd his glorious Career, M. <i>de Bruhl</i>, without suffering
himself to be too much cast down, knowing that an Ocean of Tears was too
little to shed for the Loss he had sustain'd, thought of nothing more than
paying the due Devoirs to the deceas'd Sovereign, and to the Prince, his
Son and Successor. Having therefore caus'd the Corpse of the former to be
embalm'd, and put a Seal upon all the Effects which belong'd to him,
besides securing the Jewels and Papers of Consequence; he came to
<i>Dresden</i> to join the Elector, now King of <i>Poland</i>, who received him with
such Marks of Kindness, as were enough to have put the deceas'd Monarch
out of the Minister's Thoughts, if his Gratitude had not dictated to him,
that such a King and such a Master ought never to be forgot.</p>

<p>The King confirm'd him in all the Employments and Honours which he had
held by the Favour of <i>Augustus</i> II. and moreover appointed him one of the
Ministers of his Cabinet. Some time after this, his Majesty declar'd him
President of the Chamber of Finances; consequently, this great, this true
King, by distinguishing Merit, did farther Honour to the Memory of his
august Father,
since<!--158.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
he did what that magnanimous Prince wou'd have
undoubtedly done for his Favourite.</p>

<p>At this time the Minister resign'd to the King his Office of Great Master
of the Wardrobe, which his various Occupations did not permit him to
manage with that Care he thought was necessary. After the Return of the
Court from <i>Cracow</i>, whither this Gentleman had accompany'd the King, he
marry'd the Countess <i>de Collowrat</i>, one of the Queen's Ladies of Honour,
whose high Birth was supported with such personal Qualities as can never
be enough commended. The Bride being a <i>Roman</i> Catholic, the Ceremony of
the Marriage was performed at <i>Moritzbourg</i>, in presence of their
Majesties, by the Bishop of <i>Cracow</i>. Never was a Couple better match'd;
the Lady's Person being a Collection of Charms, and M. <i>de Bruhl</i> a Man of
as noble Presence as one wou'd wish to see; which he generally sets off
with a rich Dress of a good Fancy. No body at Court surpasses him in a
generous way of living; for he keeps a noble Table, and at his House
Persons of Distinction have their Assemblies. This Minister has something
so attracting in his Looks and Behaviour that he easily wins the Hearts of
People who are the most indifferent to him. He is so polite, affable, and
engaging, that he listens attentively to those who lay their Wants before
him, returns them courteous and distinct Answers; and whenever he is
constrain'd to give a Denial, he does it in such a manner as plainly
demonstrates his Concern that 'tis not in his power to oblige. And 'tis
owing to this Good-nature of his, and to the Kindness with which he treats
his Inferiors, that he can boast of possessing the Love and Veneration of
the Public.</p>

<p>In short, the Count <i>de Sulkowski</i> who has the first place in the Cabinet,
and this Gentleman who has the second, are the Ministers who decide all
Affairs<!--159.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
with the King's good Pleasure. They are Gentlemen who know
nothing of Jealousy nor Envy; and, as they act from one and the same
Principle, so they have both the same View, which is to increase, if
possible, the Glory of the King, and the Happiness of the Government.</p>

<p>The Office of all the above-mention'd, as Ministers of the Cabinet, is so
eminent at this Court that it gives those who are invested with it the
Precedence of all the Generals, both of Horse and Foot.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are three other Ministers of the Cabinet, who, tho'
retir'd from Court, enjoy the Rank and Pensions annex'd to the Ministry.
They are the Count <i>de Manteuffel</i>, the Count <i>de Promnitz</i>, and the
Marquiss <i>de Fleuri</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ernest</i> Count <i>de Manteuffel</i>, Knight of the Order of the White Eagle, is
descended of a Family which has been for a long time of distinguish'd Rank
in <i>Prussian Pomerania</i>. He was Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to <i>Frederic</i>
I. King of <i>Prussia</i>. Certain Ballads being handed about at Court, which
were insulting Lampoons upon the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>, the King's Prime
Minister and Favourite, M. <i>de Manteuffel</i> was charged with being the
Author of 'em; who knowing that the Favourite wou'd not put up with the
Affront, retir'd to <i>Saxony</i>, where the Count <i>de Flemming</i>, who then bore
the greatest sway at the King of <i>Poland</i>'s Court, receiv'd him as his
Countryman, and employ'd him in foreign Affairs; which he managed with the
Approbation both of his Majesty and the foreign Ministers he had to treat
with. M. <i>de Manteuffel</i> kept in with the Favourite without giving into
the Flattery which that Minister expected from his Creatures; and while
the King was Vicar of the Empire, he made M. <i>de Manteuffel</i> Count of the
Empire. His Majesty had some time before honour'd him with the Order of
the White Eagle, and preferr'd him to his Cabinet-Council; and after
Marshal
<i>Flemming</i>'s<!--160.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Death, M. <i>de Manteuffel</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> had the principal
Direction of the foreign Affairs. But this able Minister, and one of the
chief Ornaments and Confidents of the late King's Court, retir'd from it
in 1730, to his Estate in <i>Pomerania</i>, and now resides at <i>Berlin</i>; where
he still enjoys a Pension of 24000 Crowns, or 12000 Rixdollars, which was
secur'd to him by the present Elector. It adds to his Character, that
after he was retired, the Want of him was lamented.</p>

<p>He is pretty tall, well set, has a grand Air, and is one of the handsomest
Men that I have seen. His Behaviour is noble and easy, he has a good Fund
of Learning, an extraordinary Memory, and such a Happiness of expressing
himself that when he talks he never fails to give Pleasure. He lives
nobly, and when he was at <i>Dresden</i> his House was open to all Persons of
Distinction and Merit. He married a Baroness of <i>Pludouska</i>, who is, as
well as himself, of the <i>Lutheran</i> Religion.</p>

<p><i>Erdmann</i>, Count <i>de Promnitz</i>, is more at his Estate than at Court; he is
also Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. He married a Princess of
<i>Saxe-Weissenfels</i>. He always distinguish'd himself by his Zeal, and his
Attachment to the Royal Family; of which he gave Proofs by raising an
Independent Company at his own Expence, for the Service of the late King,
which he sent to reinforce his Majesty's Troops in the Camp before
<i>Zeithaim</i>: And for the same Use he has since rais'd a Regiment of Horse.</p>

<p><i>Francis Vicardel</i>, Marquiss <i>de Fleuri</i> and <i>de Beaufort</i>, is a
<i>Savoyard</i>. He was the King of <i>Sardinia</i>'s Minister, and his Envoy to the
Court of <i>Vienna</i>, when the late King of <i>Poland</i> invited him into his
Service, admitted him to his
Cabinet-Council,<!--161.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
and made him a Knight of
his Order. This Minister is endow'd with all the Talents that can be
desir'd in a Man who has an Employment. He has an agreeable Aspect,
engaging Manners, a just Discernment, a quick Apprehension, and a very
even Temper. But his frequent Ailments disabling him from the Exercise of
his Talents, he desir'd, and obtain'd leave to retire to his Estate in
<i>Savoy</i>; and the late King, who had always a great and noble Soul, being
desirous that he shou'd be a Witness of his Goodness and Royal
Magnificence, secur'd the Enjoyment of his Pensions to him; which the
present King has also been pleased to confirm.</p>

<p>Another of the Cabinet Ministers, who was also formerly Prime Minister to
the late King of <i>Poland</i>, was the Count <i>de Hoym</i>, descended from one of
the principal Families in <i>Saxony</i>, and Brother to the Gentleman that
married Madame <i>de Cosel</i>. I knew him intimately before he was advanced to
the Ministry, at <i>Paris</i>, and at <i>Vienna</i>, as well as here at <i>Dresden</i>.
You must have seen him in <i>Silesia</i>, where he has a very fine Estate.
There is not a Minister at this Court more civil, more learned, or a
better Friend to learned Men. During his long Residence at <i>Paris</i> as
Ambassador from the King of <i>Poland</i>, his House was open to all Men of
Learning as it is now at <i>Dresden</i>; and he had the splendid Title given
him of the <i>Mecænas</i> of <i>Saxony</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<!--162.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>They who are actually <span class="smcap">Privy Counsellors</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ministers of State</span> here, are
eight in number. They are descended from some of the best Families in
<i>Saxony</i>, and profess the Protestant Religion. The Detail of their
Characters, their Experience, and their Merit, wou'd oblige me to
transgress the Limits of this Work, were I only to treat of those who are
bound by their Employments to attend the King's Person, and who compose
his Majesty's Houshold. But for the Reputation of the Privy Council, 'tis
proper just to observe that all its Members are Subjects who do Honour to
the King's Choice; that they are vigilant for
promoting<!--163.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the Good of the
Public, and that in their Deliberations they manifest their Zeal for the
King, and their Affection to their Country.</p>

<p>The President of this Council, is <i>Alexander de Miltitz de Scharffenberg</i>,
who is a Native of <i>Saxony</i>, the same that was the King's Governour; of
whom so much has been already said, that I avoid to make any more
particular mention of him here.</p>

<p>Two of the Privy Counsellors are Counsellors of the Conferences, which are
held in presence of his Majesty, <i>viz.</i> <i>Gotlob-Frederic</i> Baron <i>de
Gersdorff</i>, and <i>Bernard</i> Baron <i>de Zech</i>. The former comes from an
ancient Family of Distinction,
which<!--164.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
has given several great Men to this
State. The latter has acquitted himself with Success in the several
Negociations wherein he has been employ'd. They are both laborious,
vigilant, upright Men, and of great Experience in Business.</p>

<p><i>The King's</i> <span class="smcap">Great Officers</span><i> are,</i></p>

<p>I. The <span class="smcap">Grand Marshal</span>; which Office is now held by <i>Waldemar</i>, Baron <i>de
Lowendahl</i>, who has under him</p>

<div class="center">The Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber,<br />
The Pages,<br />
The Huntsmen,<br />
The Musicians of the Chapel and the Chamber,<br />
The Dancers,<br />
The Comedians,<br />
The Trumpeters,<br />
The Footmen,<br />
The <i>Turks</i>,<br />
The <i>Heydukes</i>,<br />
The Messengers,<br />
The <i>Negroes</i>;</div>

<p>and in short, a considerable number of other Officers and Domestics of the
King's Houshold. His Jurisdiction extends not only over those that I have
mention'd, but also over all Foreigners of Quality who happen to be at
<i>Dresden</i>; and there is a Tribunal or Court for this purpose, of which the
Great Chamberlain, the Great Master of the Kitchens, the Great Cup-Bearer
and the Marshal of the Court are Members.</p>

<p>II. The <span class="smcap">Great Chamberlain</span>; who is at present <i>Henry-Frederic</i> Count of
<i>Friesland</i>. 'Tis he that receives the Ambassadors and other foreign
Ministers, and introduces them to an Audience of the King. He has under
him the several Chamberlains.</p>

<p>III. The <span class="smcap">Master</span> of the <span class="smcap">Horse</span>, <i>Alexander-Joseph</i> Count <i>de Sulkowski</i>, is
in possession of this Office, which is one of the best and noblest
Employments<!--165.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
at Court, the Person who is invested with it being serv'd by
the King's Equipages and Livery, and having the disposal of all the
inferior Offices appertaining to the Stables. He has under him the
Equerries, the Prickers, and all the Workmen employ'd for the Service of
the Stables, and the making of the Equipages.</p>

<p>He that is the only chief Equerry is <i>Adolphus de Bruhl</i>, one of the
King's Chamberlains. He officiates in the absence of the Master of the
Horse, is Brother to <i>Henry de Bruhl</i> Minister of the Cabinet, and
resembles him in Candour and Integrity. His Honesty, which is imprinted on
his very Countenance, reflects a Lustre on all his Actions. He is so
sensible of the Charms of Friendship that he fulfils all the Obligations
of it; and besides those Qualities of the Mind, he makes an agreeable
Appearance, is dextrous in his Exercises, has a solid Relish of the Arts
and Sciences, is perfect Master of Music, and plays on several
Instruments.</p>

<p>He was heretofore in the Service of the Duke Regent of <i>Weissenfels</i>, and
next in that of the Duke of <i>Saxe-Weimar</i>, who had such an Esteem for his
Merit that to him he referred the Direction of his Court. Nevertheless he
left this Prince, and enter'd into the Service of the late King, who
conferred those Employments on him which he now enjoys. Since he came to
Court, he married a young Lady of Quality of the Family of <i>Opelen</i>, whose
Fortune and Charms into the bargain made her such a considerable Match
that she did not want Suitors.</p>

<p>IV. The <span class="smcap">Great Huntsman</span>. The Gentleman who at present possesses this
Office, one of the most lucrative at Court, is <i>Charles de Leubnitz</i>. It
gives him the Superintendance over all the Officers of the Venery, in
which Number are included the Rangers, the Verdurers, the Gentlemen and
Pages,<!--166.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and above a hundred Huntsmen or other Persons depending on them.
The Great Huntsman is a Protestant, as well as his Lady, who is of the
Family of <i>Schaurot</i>.</p>

<p>V. The <span class="smcap">Great Master</span> of the <span class="smcap">Kitchens</span> is <i>Adolphus</i> Baron <i>de Seyffertitz</i>,
of a Family which has been for a long time distinguish'd in this
Electorate. His first Step at Court was in the Employment of Gentleman of
the Bed-Chamber. <i>Augustus</i> II. at the request of the late Czar <i>Peter the
Great</i>, plac'd him Governor to the Czarowitz when that young Prince came
into <i>Germany</i>. He continued in this Post till after the Marriage of the
Czarowitz to the Princess of <i>Brunswic-Wolfembuttle-Blanckenbourg</i>. After
his return to <i>Saxony</i> he accompanied the late King to <i>Berlin</i>, when his
Majesty together with <i>Frederic</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>, went thither to
make a visit to <i>Frederic</i> I. King of <i>Prussia</i>. In 1711, M. <i>de
Seyffertitz</i> was appointed Marshal of the Embassy which <i>Augustus</i> II.
sent to <i>Francfort</i>, for the Election of an Emperor. His Imperial Majesty
<i>Charles</i> VI. at the Ceremony of his Coronation, made him a Knight of the
Empire, and at length the late King made him one of his Chamberlains, and
then Great Master of the Kitchens, which Office he manages with Dignity
and Politeness. He married a Lady of the Family of <i>Haxthausen</i>, Widow of
the Count <i>de Beichling</i> the Great Faulconer. They are both of the
<i>Lutheran</i> Communion.</p>

<p>In the absence of the Grand Marshal, the Great Master of the Kitchens
officiates, and at the grand Ceremonies wears like him a Staff tipp'd with
Silver gilt. Under his Province are the Comptrollers of the Kitchen and of

<p>VI. The <span class="smcap">Great Cup-Bearer</span> is <i>John-Adolphus de Haugwitz</i>, a Gentleman of
good Extraction. His Father was Grand Marshal to the late King. He is a
handsome Man, has a noble Mien, performs all sorts of Exercises with a
Grace and with Dexterity, and does the Honours of the Court in a becoming
manner. He is of the Protestant Religion, and married to a Lady of the
Family of <i>Beist</i>. His Employment sets him above all the Officers of the
King's Buttery, Cellar, and Pantry. In the absence of the Grand Marshal
and the Master of the Kitchens, he officiates for them, and at great
Ceremonies he carries like them a Staff of Silver gilt.</p>

<p>VII. The <span class="smcap">Great Faulconer</span> is an Office held by <i>Anthony</i> Count <i>de
Moschinski</i>, a <i>Polish</i> Nobleman, and a <i>Roman</i> Catholic. He was formerly
Page to the King, and attended his Majesty in his Tours to <i>France</i> and
<i>Italy</i>, where he acquir'd great Politeness, and a very engaging
Deportment. At his return to <i>Dresden</i>, he was made one of the Gentlemen
of the Bed-Chamber to the King, who was then the Prince Royal. Afterwards
the late King appointed him one of his Chamberlains; and when the Count
<i>de Fitztuhm</i> unhappily lost his life at <i>Warsaw</i>, his Majesty who had
given his Office of Great Chamberlain to the Count <i>de Friesland</i>,
bestow'd that of <i>Great Faulconer</i>, which was held by that Nobleman, upon
the Count <i>de Moschinski</i>, who was grac'd almost at the same time with the
Order of the <i>White Eagle</i>, and the Post of Treasurer to the Court of
<i>Poland</i>. His Majesty also granted him in Marriage one of his natural
Children, the Daughter of the Countess <i>de Cosel</i>. Never was a Person more
deserving of Honours than the Great Faulconer, who is truly magnificent,
and makes such an Appearance, that he does an Honour to his Character. By
his Behaviour he engages the Friendship and Regard of all that have to do
with him. He
has<!--168.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
under his command the Officers of the Faulconry or Mews
where the Hawks are kept, the Faulconers, and in general all those Persons
that have any relation to the Faulconry.</p>

<p>VIII. The <span class="smcap">Great Master</span> of the <span class="smcap">Wardrobe</span> is <i>Alexander-Joseph</i> Count <i>de
Sulkowski</i>. He has under his Jurisdiction the <i>Catholic</i> Clergy, the
<i>Physicians</i> of the <i>Body</i>, the <i>Footmen</i>, the <i>Secretaries</i>, <i>Writers</i>
and <i>Clerks</i> of the <i>Chamber</i>, the <i>Inspectors</i> of the <i>Chamber</i> of
<i>Curiosities</i>, the <i>Ushers</i> of the <i>Chamber</i> and of the <i>King's Closet</i>,

<p>IX. The <span class="smcap">Post-Master-General</span> is <i>Maurice-Charles</i> Count <i>de Linar</i>, who is
also one of the Chamberlains, and a Knight of the Order of St. <i>John</i>. He
is descended from a Family which has been of Eminence for a long time in
this Electorate. His good Mien is answerable to his Birth, and by his
Politeness, his Manners, and his Expences, he does an honour to the Prince
that employs him. The King, after his Coronation, sent him to <i>Muscovy</i> to
notify the Accomplishment of that Ceremony to the Empress of the
<i>Russians</i>, and he still continues at that Princess's Court, to take care
of his Master's Interests, which he does in a way that cannot but turn to
his own Advantage, and the Honour of the King.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This Gentleman was also
employ'd by the late King at the Court of <i>Prussia</i>, and at the <i>British</i>
Court when at <i>Hanover</i>, and always discharg'd his Commissions with such
Success as was crown'd with his Majesty's Approbation.</p>

<p>X. The <span class="smcap">Marshal</span> of the <span class="smcap">Court</span> is <i>John-George d'Einsiedel</i>, who is also a
Privy-Counsellor, and a Gentleman of a good Family, his Ancestors having
<!--169.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>possessed
the chief Offices of the State. He has visited the principal
Courts of <i>Europe</i>, where he contracted that polite Turn which is seen in
his Behaviour. He is a handsome Man, has a noble Air, and his Demeanour is
answerable. He knows a great deal, and performs all the academical
Exercises very well. He married the Daughter of the General Count <i>de
Flemming</i> Governor of <i>Leipsic</i>, who was a rich Heiress, and to be valued
for the Qualities of her Mind. The Marshal of the Court and his Lady are
both of the <i>Lutheran</i> Communion. His Office joins him in Commission with
the Grand Marshal, the Great Master of the Kitchens, and the Great
Cup-Bearer; and like those Officers he carries the short Staff of Silver
gilt at the grand Ceremonies. 'Tis commonly he that makes the
Court-Entertainments.</p>

<p><i>Curt d'Einsiedel</i> Marshal of the Court, and one of the Chamberlains, is
remarked for his genteel Mien and Extraction. His good Qualities and
Deportment render him worthy of all Employments. He is of the establish'd
Religion of <i>Saxony</i>, and lately married Madamoiselle <i>de Schoneberg de
Maxen</i>, whose Personal Charms are an Ornament to the Court.</p>

<p><i>Ernest-Ferdinand d'Ermandsdorff</i>, Marshal of the King's Houshold, and one
of the Chamberlains, has procur'd himself Esteem by his Merit as well as
his good Birth and Breeding. Besides his Knowledge of various kinds which
qualifies him for Business, he is Master of several Languages,
particularly the <i>French</i>. He married a Lady of the Family of <i>Hesler</i>,
and they are both of the <i>Lutheran</i> Religion.</p>

<p>XI. The <span class="smcap">Chamberlains</span>. Of these there are too many to be all mention'd
here, so that I shall only take notice of the twelve Pensioners who are in
waiting about their Majesties, and without regarding the Seniority of
their Admittance.
They<!--170.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
commonly attend the King and Queen, each a whole
Week in their turn, and have the Rank of Major-Generals. The finest
Prerogative of their Employment; is the Honour of eating with their
Majesties when they are in Waiting, and of being the Depositaries of the
Petitions which are presented to the King in his Passage.</p>

<p>1. <i>Henry Rodolph de Schonfeld</i>, Lord of <i>Lowenitz</i>, is the King's first
Chamberlain. He has a fine Presence and Behaviour, and a sweet and amiable
Temper. He keeps a handsome Table and Equipage, suitable to his Fortune.
He attended the King, by his Majesty's Order, to <i>Cracow</i>, and lastly to
<i>Oliva</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Helmuth de Plesk</i> is of a Family in the Dutchy of <i>Holstein</i>, of some
Note for their great Estate there, and for the Rank they bear at the Court
of <i>Denmark</i>, where several Lords of <i>Plesk</i> are in the Ministry. The
Gentleman here mention'd is actually the King's Envoy Extraordinary to the
Court of <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Augustus-Henry Gottlob</i>, Count <i>de Callenberg</i>, is of this Electorate,
where his Family has for a long time enjoy'd a considerable Rank, and a
fine Estate. He has been the King's Envoy Extraordinary to the Courts of
<i>France</i>, <i>Brussels</i>, <i>Cologn</i>, <i>Triers</i>, and the Elector <i>Palatine</i>, to
notify the Death of the late King, and the Accession of their present
Majesties to the Electorate. He married the Countess of <i>Bose</i>, lives
nobly, and adorns the Court by his Politeness. He is of the Protestant
Communion.</p>

<p>4. <i>John-George de Carlowitz</i> is of the same Religion. He is a <i>Saxon</i>,
and married to Madamoiselle <i>de Neitsch</i>. He has a peculiar Talent of
gaining the Love of all Mankind; which he owes to his Travels, and his
natural Genius.</p>

<p>5. <i>Frederic-Augustus de Brandstein</i>, after having finish'd his Studies at
<i>Wittenberg</i>, travell'd to
good<!--171.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
purpose to the principal Countries of
<i>Europe</i>. At his return the late King declar'd him a Gentleman of his
Bed-Chamber, and some time after one of his Chamberlains. He is well
descended, and what is convenient for a Courtier, he adheres to the
Religion which is uppermost in the State.</p>

<p>6. <i>Detler-Henry d'Einsiedel</i>, Brother to the Marshal of the Court,
honours his Name by his personal Qualities. He is a handsome tall
Gentleman, has a grand Presence, and few Gentlemen surpass him in Good
Manners, Address, and polite Literature. He study'd at <i>Wittenberg</i>, and
afterwards made a Visit to the principal Courts of <i>Europe</i>: The last he
made was to that of <i>Sweden</i>, whither he was sent by the King to notify
the Death of his late Majesty, and the Accession of his present Majesty to
the Electorate.</p>

<p>7. <i>Sigismond d'Arnim</i>, is not only one of the King's Chamberlains, but
Colonel of a Regiment of Horse. He is of an ancient Family which has Lands
in <i>Lusatia</i>. His Employments are owing both to his Birth and personal
Merit. He is of the Religion of the Country.</p>

<p>8. <i>Maximilian</i>, Count <i>d'Herzan</i>, is of <i>Bohemia</i>. The late Countess his
Mother was the Queen's first Lady of Honour, and attended her Majesty
hither from <i>Vienna</i>. He is able to cut a Figure at Court, but is absent
above half of his time; and is a <i>Roman</i> Catholic.</p>

<p>9. <i>Charles-Christian de Minckwitz</i>, is a Gentleman of a fine Mien. As he
has been a great Traveller, he has acquir'd a great share of Knowledge and
Politeness. He was born a <i>Saxon</i>, but has embrac'd the <i>Roman</i> Catholic
Faith; tho' he has defeated himself by it of the Reversion of a
considerable Inheritance.</p>

<p>10. <i>Henry-Augustus de Breitenbauch</i>, is a Gentleman of fine Sense and
Manners suitable to his
Extraction.<!--172.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Such is his good Taste and Skill in
Music, that he has been singled out for the Direction of the King's
Pleasures. He is of the Communion of the Country, and marry'd to a Lady of
the Family of <i>Schonberg</i>.</p>

<p>11. <i>Nicholas-Schwizinski</i> is a Native of <i>Poland</i>; he has valuable
Qualities, and a great Attachment to the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Religion.</p>

<p>12. <i>N. N. de Sehgutt-Stanislawski</i> is of a Family which was formerly
possess'd of a great Estate in <i>Silesia</i>, with the Title of the Counts <i>de
Sehgutt</i>, till the Conquest of the Country by the <i>Teutonic</i> Knights, when
his Ancestors remov'd to <i>Prussia</i>; and spreading afterwards in <i>Poland</i>,
they assum'd the Name of <i>Stanislawski</i>, as what was more agreeable to the
<i>Poles</i>. This Chamberlain is a Person of strict Honour and Integrity,
without any manner of Guile. He spent his Youth at the Academy of <i>Berlin</i>
which was erected by King <i>Frederic</i> I. and afterwards enter'd as
Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to <i>Augustus</i> II. who not many Years after
made him a Chamberlain of <i>Poland</i>, and put him upon the Establishment of
<i>Saxony</i>; and when the present King came to the Government, he continued
him in his Employment. His Majesty also made choice of him to attend him
to <i>Cracow</i>, and lastly to <i>Oliva</i>.</p>

<p>XII. Of the <span class="smcap">Steward</span> of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Houshold</span>. Since the Queen's Arrival at
<i>Dresden</i>, there have been four Stewards of her Majesty's Houshold. The
Count <i>de Diedrichstein</i> was the first that had this Place, which he
resign'd for the Grand Priory of <i>Bohemia</i>. His Successor was the Count
<i>de Konigsegg</i> who actually commands the Emperor's Army in <i>Lombardy</i>.
This General being recall'd to <i>Vienna</i>, was replac'd by the Count <i>de
Wratislau</i>, and he by the Count <i>de Waldstein</i> who lately quitted that
Post to go and take possession
of<!--173.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the Office of <i>Landshauptmann</i>, or
Intendant of <i>Silesia</i>, which was conferr'd on him by the Emperor. The
Count <i>de Wratislaw</i>, who has the care of his Imperial Majesty's Affairs
at this Court, officiates there again as Steward. This is the Officer who
leads the Queen, and gives Orders to all her Officers and Domestics, and
who must be apply'd to by those that solicite for an Audience of her
Majesty.</p>

<p>XIII. The <i>Queen's first Lady of Honour</i>, is <i>Theresa</i> Baroness of
<i>Stein</i>, and Countess Dowager of <i>Collowrat</i>; who honours her Station by
her Virtues, and by the Dignity with which she fills it. The late Count
<i>de Collowrat</i> her Husband was Great Chamberlain of <i>Bohemia</i>, and one of
the chief Noblemen of that Kingdom. This Lady, his Relict, is a <i>Roman</i>
Catholic, and is such in an exemplary manner. Those Ladies who want to
kiss the Queen's Hand, or to pay their Duty to her, must apply to this
Lady, who introduces and presents them. She has the Precedence before all
other Ladies, and only yields it to the Princesses of the Blood.</p>

<p>XIV. Of the <i>Governess of the Ladies of Honour, and of the Ladies of
Honour themselves</i>. In the absence of the first Lady of Honour, the
Governess of the Ladies officiates. The Baroness Dowager of <i>Rohr</i>
worthily fills this Station, and has under her six Ladies, two of whom,
<i>viz.</i> the Countesses of <i>Waldstein</i> and <i>Kokersowitz</i>, are Ladies of the
Bed-Chamber, a Title which procures them Admittance to the Queen's Closet.
All the Ladies of Honour must always appear in the Court-Dress. Their
manner of Living is such that it obliges Calumny itself to respect them.</p>

<p>XV. Of the <i>Lords and Ladies that are attach'd to the Court by their
Offices, or by the Favours of the King</i>.</p>

<!--174.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Tho' the <i>Polish</i> Lords cannot be put upon the Establishment of the Court
of <i>Saxony</i>, that there may be nothing in common between the two States,
yet it may be thought inexcusable not to mention in this place
<i>John-Alexander Lipski</i>, Bishop of <i>Cracow</i>, Duke of <i>Servia</i>, and Great
Chancellor of <i>Poland</i>; not only because this Prelate, who is descended
from one of the best Families in the Kingdom, was appointed Bishop of
<i>Cracow</i> by the late King, but because he has given signal Proofs of his
Gratitude and Attachment to the august Family of his Benefactor. The
Virtues of this Gentleman intitle him to Respect: He is pious without
Hypocrisy, generous without Ostentation, magnificent without Pageantry,
officious meerly for the Pleasure of obliging, a Courtier without
Servility, a Man strictly attach'd to his King and his Country, learned
without being positive, a great Orator, a good Bishop, and a wise
Minister, always ready to embrace a good Proposal, and firm to support it,
laborious, vigilant, acting only out of Principle, and by consequence
susceptible of Friendship, and scorning Revenge. The late King, out of his
Esteem for the Qualities of this Prelate, made him Bishop of <i>Cracow</i>,
Great Chancellor of <i>Poland</i>, and honour'd him with his Order of the White
Eagle. By this means he so rivetted him to his Interest, and to that of
the Prince his Son, that after his Majesty's Decease, his most Reverend
Highness directed Affairs in such a manner that the Republic chose his Son
for their King. <i>Augustus</i> II. being proclaim'd accordingly, the Prince
and Bishop was appointed Head of the Embassy which the States of the
Kingdom sent to the new Monarch at <i>Tarnowitz</i>, to carry him the Diploma
of his Election. He spoke upon this occasion with a noble Eloquence,
rendering to their Majesties all due Respects, and yet maintaining the
Dignity of the most
Serene<!--175.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Republic. Having discharg'd this Commission,
he went before the King to <i>Cracow</i>, made his Entry there, and took
possession of the Bishoprick. Some days after this, he consecrated and
crown'd their Majesties in his Metropolis. When the King return'd to
<i>Saxony</i>, the Prelate followed him, and attended him to <i>Oliva</i>; and 'twas
he that receiv'd the Allegiance and Homage of the <i>Dantzickers</i> to his
Majesty. He is since come hither to rejoin the Court, is belov'd,
reverenc'd, and every one does Justice to his Virtues.</p>

<p><i>Charles-Lewis</i>, Prince of <i>Holstein-Beck</i>, Colonel in the Service of the
King, and Knight of the Order of the White Eagle, is the second Son of the
late <i>Lewis-Frederic</i> Veldt-Marshal of <i>Prussia</i>, Governour of
<i>Koningsberg</i>, and Knight of the Order of the Elephant. This Prince
married <i>Anne</i> Countess of <i>Orselska</i>, the legitimated Daughter of the
late King.</p>

<p><i>George-Ignatius</i>, Prince <i>de Lubomirski</i>, Sword-Bearer of the Crown,
Lieutenant-General of the King's Forces, Colonel of the Life-Guards, and
Knight of the Order of the White Eagle, is descended from a Family of very
great Distinction in <i>Poland</i>. After he return'd from his Travels, being
attach'd to the Court of <i>Augustus</i> II. he married the Daughter of the
Count <i>de Fitztuhm</i>, who was Great Chamberlain; a Lady of such Beauty,
such personal Charms, and such fine Sense, that she engages the Veneration
of all that know her. Prince <i>Lubomirski</i> is a jolly handsome Man, very
polite, thinks and acts agreeable to his Birth, has a good share of
Literature, and is perfect Master of Music. He lives in a handsome manner
very suitable to his Rank.</p>

<p>The <i>Princess</i> of <i>Teschen</i> is a <i>Polish</i> Lady, and ally'd to the greatest
Families in the Kingdom. Her Uncle was the famous Cardinal <i>Radjowski</i>,
<!--176.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>Archbishop
of <i>Gnesna</i>, and Primate of the Kingdom. She was formerly
marry'd to Prince <i>Lubomirski</i>, Great Chamberlain of the Crown; but the
Marriage was dissolved, so that she quitted the Name of <i>Lubomirski</i> for
that of <i>Teschen</i>, which she still bears, tho' she afterwards marry'd
Prince <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Wirtemberg</i>. This Princess supports her Rank with
Dignity, has a grand Air, is respected for a noble distinguish'd and
engaging Behaviour, and lives in so handsome a manner, that she is one of
the most shining Ornaments of this Court.</p>

<p><i>Josepha</i> Countess <i>de Lagnasco</i> is the Daughter of the Count <i>de
Wallenstein</i>, who was Great Chamberlain to the Emperor <i>Joseph</i>, and one
of the most worthy Noblemen of the Imperial Court, by <i>Eleonora</i> Countess
of <i>Losenstein</i>; a Lady whose Memory is with Justice rever'd by all
<i>Vienna</i>. The Countess <i>de Lagnasco</i> was the Widow of Count <i>Thaun</i>, when
she marry'd the late Count <i>de Lagnasco</i>, Minister of the Cabinet to
<i>Augustus</i> II. General of the <i>Saxon</i> Cavalry, Captain of the
Horse-Guards, and Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. Since that
Nobleman's Decease, which was in <i>April</i> 1732, his Widow has always liv'd
at <i>Dresden</i>; where she enjoys the Esteem of their Majesties, and the
Veneration of the Courtiers. This Countess is Mistress of several
Languages to Perfection, thoroughly understands Music, and sings with
Grace and Method. Her noble generous way of living, and her graceful and
distinguish'd Behaviour cannot be express'd, nor indeed equall'd to any
thing but the Goodness of her Temper. The late Count <i>de Lagnasco</i> is of a
good Stature, and his Behaviour polite and civil. I think you know that he
was of a Family in <i>Piedmont</i> of some Distinction. How, or when he first
enter'd into the Service of the King of <i>Poland</i>, I cannot tell you; but I
know that he presently insinuated
himself<!--177.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
into his Master's Favour, by
his very great Assiduity, agreeable Temper, and by a vast Complaisance to
enter into his Pleasures. He establish'd himself so firmly in the King's
Favour that the Count <i>de Flemming</i> look'd upon him as the only Rival he
had to fear, and therefore he never much lik'd him. The Count <i>de
Lagnasco</i> was employ'd in several Embassies; and when he had finish'd that
at <i>Rome</i>, which was his last, there was a Talk that he was to go
Ambassador to <i>Vienna</i>, and that the young Count <i>de Wackerbart</i> was to go
to <i>Rome</i>. I must further acquaint you that M. <i>de Lagnasco</i> was happy in
all respects, even in Marriage, not only with his first, but his second
Wife, who, when he married her, was a young, rich, brisk Widow. His first
Wife was the Daughter of the Count <i>de Noyelles</i>, Lieutenant-General in
<i>Holland</i>, a Lady of great Virtue, esteemed by all the People at the
<i>Hague</i>, and possess'd of a considerable Estate, of which, dying young,
and without Issue, she made her Husband sole Heir.</p>

<p><i>Francis</i>, Count <i>de Montmorency</i>, is a Name too well known to speak of
his Extraction. He was a Colonel in <i>France</i> when he went into the Service
of <i>Augustus</i> II. who receiv'd him with that Demonstration of Esteem which
that King was so ready to grant to Persons of Merit. His Majesty first
appointed him Major-General of his Forces, and some time after he declar'd
him a Lieutenant-General, and Captain of his Horse-Guards. At that time
the Count married Madame <i>Potschin</i>, Widow of the Great General of
<i>Lithuania</i>; a Lady whose Birth, Qualities, and Fortune, recommended her
for a very considerable Match. The Countess <i>de Montmorency</i>, in the time
of her former Husband, went to <i>Paris</i> for the Recovery of her Health, and
receiv'd extraordinary Honours at the <i>French</i> Court, where she was
admir'd for her
Politeness,<!--178.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the Delicacy of her Sentiments, and the Ease
with which she express'd them in the Language of <i>France</i>; from whence
they conceiv'd an advantagious Idea of the Court of <i>Augustus</i> II. not
imagining how 'twas possible for the Manners of a Foreign Lady so much to
resemble their own. She is also as much rever'd at <i>Dresden</i> as at
<i>Paris</i>; and all that know her, agree she is highly to be valued for her
Sentiments.</p>

<p><i>Antoinetta</i> of <i>Lichtenstein</i>, Countess of <i>Wallenstein</i>, is Wife to
<i>Leopold</i> Count <i>de Wallenstein</i>, heretofore Great Master of the Queen's
Houshold; a Lady both belov'd and honour'd at this place, for her Virtues
and civil Deportment; and as she is preparing to follow her Husband into
<i>Silesia</i>, she will carry with her the Esteem of their Majesties, and
leave the Court sorry for her Absence.</p>

<p>XVI. <i>Of the Foreign Ministers who reside at this Court.</i></p>

<p><i>Francis-Charles</i> Count <i>de Wratislaw</i>, one of the Emperor's Privy
Council, and Knight of the Orders of <i>Russia</i> and <i>Poland</i>, resides at
this Court in quality of Ambassador from his Imperial and Catholic
Majesty. He is descended from one of the greatest Families in the Kingdom
of <i>Bohemia</i>, and a Family which has given wise Ministers to the august
House of <i>Austria</i>. This Gentleman has been for a long time in the
Management of the most important Affairs: He was Ambassador for the
Kingdom of <i>Bohemia</i> to the Dyet of the Empire at <i>Ratisbon</i>; From thence
he went in the same Character to <i>Poland</i>, where he was present at the
Dyet of <i>Grodno</i>. The Emperor afterwards nam'd him Great Master of the
Houshold to the Princess Royal and Electoral, now Queen of <i>Poland</i>. The
Count having worthily acquitted himself of that Office, was for several
Years
Ambassador<!--179.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
at <i>Russia</i>, where he concluded that happy Alliance
subsisting between the two Empires, and acquired the Esteem of the
Empress, who honor'd him with her Order of St. <i>Andrew</i>; <i>Augustus</i> II.
having before given him that of the White Eagle.</p>

<p>This Minister, since his Return from <i>Muscovy</i>, has moreover been charg'd
by the Emperor with important Commissions to the Courts of <i>Prussia</i>,
<i>Brunswic</i>, and <i>Holstein</i>. At length he is come back again to this Court,
as Ambassador from his Imperial and Catholic Majesty; and officiates also
as Great Master of the Queen's Houshold. This Nobleman is of a middling
Stature, of a happy Physiognomy, is civil, beneficent, and loves Grandeur
and Pleasures, but does not abandon himself to them so far as to neglect
the Interests of his Master, whose Affairs he negociates with a noble
Candour which has render'd him as much esteem'd at the Courts where he has
resided, as he is beloved for his Affability and Politeness. His Wife is
the Countess of <i>Kinski</i>, whose Father was Great Chancellor of <i>Bohemia</i>,
under the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>, and whose Brother is now in that Office under
the most August <i>Charles</i> VI.</p>

<p><i>Hermann-Charles Keyserling</i>, Plenipotentiary Minister from the Empress of
the <i>Russians</i>, is of a Family of Note in <i>Courland</i>. He study'd at
<i>Koningsberg</i> in <i>Prussia</i>. After he had visited the principal Courts of
<i>Germany</i>, and return'd to his own Country, he was made Gentleman of the
Bed-Chamber to the Dutchess of <i>Courland</i>, <i>Anne</i> of <i>Muscovy</i>, the
present Empress, who employ'd him in several Commissions to the Courts of
<i>Prussia</i> and <i>Poland</i>. Nevertheless he quitted her Service for one of the
judicial Offices in that Country.</p>

<p>When <i>Anne</i> came to the Throne, the States of <i>Courland</i> deputed M.
<i>Keyserling</i> to that
Princess,<!--180.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
who offer'd him an Employment at her
Court, and appointed him Vice-President of the Chamber of Justice of the
<i>Russian</i> Empire. Some time after, she made him President of the Academy
of Sciences at <i>Petersbourg</i>, and sent him to this Court, where he
discharges his Ministerial Office with universal Approbation. The Wife of
this Minister is the Daughter of the Starost <i>Forchs</i>, who, for opposing
the Pretensions of a certain Power which challeng'd more Respect, was
assassinated at <i>Mittaw</i>. Both he and his Lady are of the <i>Lutheran</i>
Communion.</p>

<p><i>John-Hartwig-Ernest</i>, Baron of <i>Bernsdorff</i>, Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber
to the King of <i>Denmark</i>, and his Majesty's Envoy at this Court, is of a
Family which is possess'd of a fine Estate in <i>Mecklembourg</i>, and has
given an able Minister to the House of <i>Hanover</i>. The Envoy, of whom
mention is here made, does honour to his Character, and behaves with a
Prudence not inferior to Ministers of the greatest Experience.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>By the Detail I have now given you, Sir, you must have observ'd that the
chief Employments of the Court are in the hands of Foreigners, and that
<i>Saxons</i> have little to do in Affairs of State, for which they are oblig'd
indeed to the Count <i>de Flemming</i>. This vain, haughty, and imperious
Minister expected every one shou'd truckle to him. He found that
Foreigners were much more submissive than the <i>Saxons</i>, who are by nature
stately, and Enemies to Slavery in any shape. Count <i>Flemming</i> being dead,
it's probable that the <i>Saxons</i> will be more employ'd than they have been;
and indeed they have Capacities equal to any Nation in the World. They are
well made, robust, agile, laborious, good Soldiers, cunning Courtiers.
They have naturally more Spirit than the <i>French</i> allow to the <i>Germans</i>;
they improve in the Sciences,
and<!--181.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
in bodily Exercises, and they have good
Writers among them upon all sorts of Subjects; witness the Works of M.
<i>Leibnitz</i>, the famous Philosopher, and of <i>Thomasius</i>, one of the most
able Civilians of his time. The <i>Saxons</i> are addicted indeed to all
Pleasures in general, but to none so much as the Bottle and Gaming. They
love Pomp and Expence, and are naturally not very engaging, being
exceeding ceremonious, and affecting more than all the <i>Germans</i> to ape
the <i>French</i>, with whom they sympathise very much, particularly in their
Fondness for new Fashions, their Forwardness to make new Acquaintance and
Friendships, and perhaps too in their Readiness to fall out with them upon
very trivial Occasion.</p>

<p>Since I have spoke so much of the Men, I must also give you some account
of the <i>Saxon</i> Women. They are all of a fair Complexion, and there are
among them the finest Faces in the World. They are generally well shap'd
too, which is what they are chiefly taken notice of for: They are tall and
slender; they dance well, and have a surprising genteel Air, which they
take great care to improve by rich Dress. One Fault I find with them is,
that they are very affected, and that they have too much Action when they
talk. As to their Tempers, they are reckon'd to be good-natur'd; but then
they are subtile and crafty. They love Dress and Ornament more than all
Women that I ever saw. They are lively and gay, and passionately fond of
Dancing and Merriment. When they are told that they are handsome, they are
so far from being surpriz'd that they look upon it as a Compliment due to
them. When once they love, they love with Tenderness; and there are among
them such Examples of Constancy as would eclipse even a <i>Cleopatra</i>, or a
<i>Clelia</i>. These heroic Sentiments of Love they learn from Romances, which
they
are<!--182.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
vastly fond of: But this must be said to their Honour, that
Gallantry does not take up so much of their Time and Thoughts as to make
them neglect their Business; for they are laborious, dextrous, and amuse
themselves with all sorts of Work. They do every thing too with a good
Grace; and in a word it may be added to their Praise, that a <i>Saxon</i> Woman
wants nothing more to make her amiable, but an Inclination to acquire that
Character.</p>

<p>Pleasures and Recreations commonly attend the Ladies so closely, that in
treating of the one I can't but remember the other; and the Inhabitants of
<i>Dresden</i> are so much devoted to Pleasures, that I think I ought to put
them into a separate Article. When the King is at <i>Dresden</i> there are
Pleasures in abundance, such as Plays, Masquerades, Balls, Feasts, Running
at the Ring, and Races on Sleds, Turnaments, Hunting-Matches; but when the
King is in <i>Poland</i> there's a very great <i>Vacuum</i>. The Electoral Prince
and Princess are often at <i>Wermstorff</i>, alias <i>Hubertsbourg</i>; and even
when their Royal Highnesses are in Town, they are pretty retir'd: They see
Company while they are at Dinner, but for the rest of the day none come
near them besides the few that have the honour of their Confidence. The
rest are scatter'd up and down the Town to the great Disappointment of
Foreigners that happen then to be here; for there's no body keeps open
House, they being all select Societies to which 'tis very difficult to
gain admittance. If one is invited to dine with some Lord of the Court,
one has a good Dinner 'tis true, but after Dinner is over a Man knows not
how to bestow himself. One is sure of finding Company no where except at
the Houses of Madame <i>de Brebentau</i> the Widow of the great Treasurer of
<i>Poland</i>, and of the Countess <i>de Lagnasco</i>; nor are their Houses always
open, for Madame <i>de Brebentau</i>
is<!--183.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
often sick, and Madame <i>de Lagnasco</i>
often abroad, or engag'd in Parties with the Electoral Princess, and then
one knows not where to go; for there's no Play to be seen, and as for the
young People, they amuse themselves with the common Pleasures of that
Stage of Life; they drink, they game, and do something more.</p>

<p>When the King is at <i>Dresden</i>, the People partake in most of the Pleasures
of the Court, the generality of the Entertainments which the King gives
being public. Plays and Masquerades are free for any People of Fashion;
there's nothing to pay, and all divert themselves as they like best. The
Citizens Wives are more tractable here than in any Town in <i>Germany</i>: They
love to imitate the Ladies of Quality, and 'tis sometimes as good as a
Comedy to see what Airs they give themselves.</p>

<p>They are extremely fond of Dressing, which Luxurious Taste extends even to
Wives of the Mechanics, and of the Livery; so that were a Stranger to come
hither on a Sunday or a Holiday, when every body is dress'd, he wou'd be
tempted to think that <i>Plutus</i> had scatter'd all his Wealth among these
People; and a very great Nobleman, who 'tis like was not acquainted with
the God <i>Plutus</i>, returning home once from <i>Dresden</i>, told his Wife that
he was come from a City to which the Devil had carry'd all the Money.</p>

<p>The Parsons here do indeed cry aloud against these Abuses, but the worst
on't is, that like the Clergy in many other Places, they preach what they
don't practise; and while they are declaiming against Luxury and new
Fashions, they suffer their Wives and Daughters to be the first to set off
their Charms with the gayest and the newest Patterns.</p>

<p>While I am speaking of the Pastors, I must be a little more particular.
These Gentlemen stand very high in the Opinion of the Laity, and are
<!--184.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>ready
to think themselves Bishops. Having such Notions as these in their
Heads, they anathematise all that are not <i>Lutherans</i>: The <i>Catholics</i> and
the <i>Reform'd</i>, or, to speak as they do, the <i>Papists</i> and <i>Calvinists</i>,
all Christians in short who are of a contrary Opinion to those charitable
Ecclesiastics are damn'd without Mercy. Yet by the Appearance of these
severe Judges, one would think they preach'd only Peace and Paradise; and
they have such a meek, humble, modest, and timorous Air, that you wou'd be
apt to take them for Saints.</p>

<p>A few days ago I had an Adventure with one of those Clergymen, which I
will acquaint you of, because I think it may give you an Idea of their
Character; for he that sees one of them, sees all.</p>

<p>I happen'd to be making a Visit to a <i>Lutheran</i> Lady, who passes for a
very devout one: There was already a pretty deal of Company, and who
should come in to add to it but a Minister that was a Doctor, and by
consequence a Man of Importance; as such too he was receiv'd by the
Mistress of the House, who said to me as soon as she saw his Face, <i>You
will now see a holy Man</i>. The good Man, or Saint, as he wou'd be reckon'd,
enter'd the Room with his Eyes cast downward, making profound Reverences,
and prostrating himself in such a manner as if he had said <i>Domine non sum
dignus</i>. At last, after a great many Compliments, he sat down, was silent
for a few Moments, and then he spoke. His Words were all sacred, and his
Sentences such as if the wise Man himself had spoke with his Lips: <i>God be
prais'd</i> was in every Phrase, and he was hearken'd to with as much
Attention as an Oracle. I listen'd to him first like the rest, but at
length I thought I might as well talk to a pretty young Lady that sat just
by me. The Doctor offended to see the little Regard I paid to what he
said, enquir'd of the Mistress of the House who I
was.<!--185.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
She told him my
Name, and withal that I was once a <i>Calvinist</i>, but that I was turn'd
<i>Papist</i>. What a Thunder-stroke was this to the Doctor! He threw himself
to the back of his Chair, lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, sigh'd, and cry'd
out, <i>Das Gott erbarme</i>, i. e. <i>God help us</i>. Then transported by a Fit of
Zeal, he turn'd about to me and ask'd me what had induc'd me to embrace a
Religion which he treated as Idolatry? I told him that I did not think he
need to give himself any Trouble about my Conversion, since according to
his System I was damn'd when a <i>Calvinist</i> as well as when a <i>Catholic</i>.
<i>The Case is not quite the same</i>, said the Minister; but to turn <i>Papist</i>!
cry'd he, to <i>adore Baal! to become a Disciple of Antichrist! alas! it
were better to be a damn'd Calvinist!</i> I own that I had much ado to help
laughing outright at the Minister's impertinent Zeal: yet I had the
Discretion to contain myself, for I had a mind to see to what length he
wou'd carry his sanctify'd Rant. He said indeed a great deal, and because
I made no Answer, he thought he had convinc'd me, if not touch'd me to the
quick. He was actually applauding himself for the good Work he had wrought
upon my Soul, when I told him that he ought not to conclude from my
Silence that he had convinc'd me; that it neither consisted with my
Character nor my Temper to dispute about Religion, that I left every Man
to his own Opinion, and that I knew which to adhere to. <i>What Blindness is
here!</i> cry'd the Doctor again, <i>What a mad Papist are you? If you will not
be of our Communion</i>, return to the <i>Religion which you have abandon'd, in
which there are some Hopes at least that God will pardon you</i>.</p>

<p>The fanatical Doctor concluded his Exclamations by a Prayer, in which he
begg'd God to preserve every good <i>Lutheran</i> Soul from the Errors of
<!--186.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>Popery;
and then he went away, leaving the Company more scandaliz'd than
edify'd by his Zeal.</p>

<p>Formerly the Preachers had the pleasure of venting their Choler in the
Pulpit, but the King by a wise Decree, which indeed ought to be followed
in all Countries, has confin'd them to the Preaching of the Gospel, and to
treat of Controversial Matters no farther than is merely necessary for the
People's Instruction. For the rest, the Parsons need not fear being soon
supplanted, for the <i>Saxons</i> are hearty <i>Lutherans</i>; and if they tolerate
the Catholics, 'tis because they can't help it. They have excluded them
from Offices in the Courts of Judicature, and from the Privilege of
enjoying Lands; but they have not been able to keep them out of Places in
the Ministry, or at Court, nor from Employments in the Army, which are
three very engaging Articles to make Proselytes among the Gentry.</p>

<h2>LETTER VI.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Weimar, Sept. 5, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>Before I write you an account of what became of me when I left <i>Dresden</i>,
I shall endeavour to give you the Intelligence you desire concerning the
late Count <i>de Flemming</i>, Prime Minister and Velt-Marshal of <i>Saxony</i>.
That Nobleman was of a good Extraction, being descended of a Family which
pretends to derive its Origin from that of <i>Flemming</i>, which has been of
considerable Rank for a long time in <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Sweden</i>, <i>Germany</i>, and
<i>Poland</i>. My Lord <i>Wigtoun</i> is the Chief of that Family in <i>Scotland</i>.</p>

<p><i>James-Henry</i> Count <i>de Flemming</i>, whose Pourtraiture and Character you
desire of me, was born the 8th of <i>March</i> 1667. His Father was President
of the Regency of <i>Stargard</i>, the Capital of <i>Prussian Pomerania</i>, who had
three Sons, of whom this Count was the second. He had an Education
suitable to his Birth. He study'd first at <i>Francfort</i> upon the <i>Oder</i>,
and afterwards at <i>Utrecht</i> under the celebrated <i>Grevius</i>, where he
learnt <i>Latin</i> to such a degree that he always spoke it with very great
Eloquence. After he had finish'd his Studies he enter'd into the Service
of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, where the Baron <i>de Span</i>, his Uncle by the Mother's
side, was Velt-Marshal. His first Preferment was to a Pair of Colours; but
in a little time he had a Company given him, which he commanded at the
Battle of <i>Orbassan</i> in <i>Piedmont</i>. In 1694, he enter'd as a
<!--188.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>Lieutenant-Colonel
into the Service of <i>John-George</i> IV. Elector of
<i>Saxony</i>; upon whose Death, and the Succession of <i>Frederic-Augustus</i>,
<i>Flemming</i> obtain'd a Regiment, and accompany'd the new Elector into
<i>Hungary</i>, where he commanded the Emperor's Army against the Infidels
during the Campaigns of 1695, and 1696. There it was that <i>Flemming</i>
kill'd in a Duel the Baron <i>de Lovel</i>, who was Lieutenant-Colonel in the
Service of <i>Saxony</i>. In 1697, he was sent into <i>Poland</i>, where, by the
Interest of his Cousin-german, the Daughter of Velt-Marshal <i>Span</i> of
<i>Berlin</i>, Wife of M. <i>Brebentau</i> Palatine of <i>Marienbourg</i>, who died Great
Treasurer of <i>Poland</i>, and by the Credit of <i>Benedict Sapieha</i> he had the
Happiness of getting his Master chose King of <i>Poland</i>. This Negotiation
obtain'd him the Post of Major-General, and laid the Foundation of his
Fortune. In 1700, he was made a Lieutenant-General, and in that Quality
laid siege to <i>Riga</i>, which the King of <i>Sweden</i> oblig'd him to raise. In
1702, he marry'd <i>Sapieha</i>, a Daughter of one of the chief Noblemen of
<i>Lithuania</i>. He was wounded the same Year at the Battle of <i>Clischhoff</i>,
at which time the King of <i>Sweden</i> being every where victorious, demanded
that the King of <i>Poland</i> shou'd deliver up <i>Flemming</i> to him. But upon
this he retir'd to <i>Brandenbourg</i>, till King <i>Stanislaus</i> had made
<i>Charles</i> XII. easy. <i>Flemming</i> being return'd to <i>Saxony</i>, fought a Duel
with M. <i>de Schulembourg</i>, who giving him a Fall, insisted that he should
beg his Life; but <i>Flemming</i> got out of this ugly Scrape by a scurvy Joke,
and <i>Schulembourg</i> gave him his Life. The latter was a younger
Lieutenant-General than <i>Flemming</i>, but in every respect his Rival, and
wou'd have been a Marshal if his Fortune had been as good as his Valour.
At the Battle of <i>Frauenstad</i> in 1705, where he was defeated by the
<i>Swedes</i>, <i>Schulembourg</i>
quitted<!--189.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the Service of <i>Saxony</i> and went into
that <i>of Venice</i>. By this means <i>Flemming</i>, who had now no Rival left, was
made a Marshal, and happen'd to be at <i>Dresden</i> when the King of <i>Sweden</i>
made that strange Visit to the King of <i>Poland</i>; at which time, if
<i>Augustus</i> had been as ungenerous as <i>Flemming</i>, <i>Charles</i> wou'd have been
detain'd. Many People accuse <i>Flemming</i> of having persuaded the King his
Master to deliver up <i>Patkul</i>: This I can't pretend to affirm, but that
there was a mortal Antipathy betwixt him and the Minister of <i>Russia</i> is
certain; for the latter having presented a Memorial to the King of
<i>Poland</i>, setting forth the wretched condition of the <i>Muscovite</i> Troops
in the Pay of <i>Saxony</i>, concluded it with these <i>Latin</i> Words,</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Dixi, et Salvavi Animam.</span></div>

<p>Which Memorial, when <i>Flemming</i> had read, and found himself not very well
used in it, he took a Pen and underwrote these Words,</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Maledixisti, et Damnaberis.</span></div>

<p>After the Disaster which <i>Charles</i> XII. met with near <i>Pultowa</i>,
<i>Flemming</i> contributed very much to the Re-establishment of King
<i>Augustus</i> in <i>Poland</i>. He confirm'd the Alliance betwixt his Master and
the Czar, made Peace with the Confederates, and concluded another Alliance
with <i>Denmark</i>. The Czar and the King of <i>Denmark</i> honour'd him with their
Orders of Knighthood, and he had that of <i>Poland</i> before. He went
Ambassador to the unsuccessful Congress at <i>Brunswic</i>, and was afterwards
at <i>Hanover</i> to attend <i>George</i> I. King of <i>Great Britain</i>. When the King
of <i>Sweden</i> return'd to <i>Pomerania</i>, <i>Flemming</i> left no Stone unturn'd to
draw the King of <i>Prussia</i> into his Master's Alliance. He had some Years
before procur'd him the Sequestration of the Town of <i>Stetin</i>, and 'twas
lucky
enough<!--190.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
for him that the Pride and Obstinacy of the King of <i>Sweden</i>
obliged the King of <i>Prussia</i> to declare himself his Enemy. At that time
<i>Flemming</i> was rather a Courier between <i>Dresden</i>, <i>Berlin</i>, and <i>Warsaw</i>,
than an Ambassador and Prime Minister, which Dignity he enjoy'd after the
Death of the Prince <i>de Furstemberg</i> his Predecessor. When the Peace of
the North was settled, <i>Flemming</i> went Ambassador to <i>Vienna</i>, where he
concluded the Marriage of the Electoral Prince of <i>Saxony</i> with the
Archduchess, eldest Daughter to the Emperor <i>Joseph</i>, tho' the Contract
had been settled before by the Count de <i>Wackerbarth</i>, who it may be said
had the Pains to negotiate it, and <i>Flemming</i> the Glory of finishing it.</p>

<p>At this time Count <i>Flemming</i> had resign'd all the Salaries of his
Employments in <i>Saxony</i>, and only reserv'd to himself the private
Perquisites and the Franchise of the Post-Offices; and his Journeys, which
were very frequent, were all at the Expence of the King. It was about this
time that he caus'd his Marriage with <i>Sapieha</i> to be dissolv'd, and
marry'd one <i>Radzevil</i>, by whom he had a Son, who was but a Year and a
half old when the Count died at <i>Vienna</i>, to which place he was return'd
with the Character of Ambassador. He left all his Estate to this Child,
without making any Intail on his Family; so that when this Son died, who
did not long survive him, his Estate went to Madame <i>de Flemming</i>, who by
marrying again carry'd the Bulk of it into another Family. They say that
his Inheritance was worth sixteen Millions of Crowns, exclusive of what he
had expended during the Splendor of his Fortune, which lasted thirty
Years, or thereabouts. Whether <i>Richelieu</i> and <i>Mazarine</i> got greater
Estates, I cannot say; but in <i>Germany</i> there is not an Instance of one
sooner acquir'd, more resplendent, and better supported than his was. He
was Prime Minister, Velt-Marshal
of<!--191.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
<i>Saxony</i>, and Master of the Horse of
<i>Lithuania</i>; by which Offices he gain'd immense Sums. He made considerable
Purchases in <i>Silesia</i> and <i>Poland</i>, but very little in <i>Saxony</i>. Whether
he left any thing to the King is not said; tho' he ought really to have
made him some Restitution, and he might naturally have given up with a
good Grace what he cou'd not but foresee wou'd be taken by force from his
Heir. As it was just that his Succession shou'd pass thro' the Purgatory
of a <i>Chambre Ardente</i>, the King establish'd one, which 'tis said has
adjudg'd eight Millions to his Majesty, and the same to his Widow; which
is a very fair Dividend.</p>

<p>Count <i>Flemming</i> was taller than ordinary, but a handsome Man; he had very
regular Features, a lively Eye, a disdainful Sneer, a haughty Air, and he
was really proud, and beyond measure ambitious. He was generous to a
degree of Ostentation, and always aim'd to do something to be talk'd of.
He was vigilant, laborious, indefatigable, allow'd himself little Sleep;
and whenever he took a Debauch, a Nap of two Hours set him to rights
again. It was no more for him to go from a Debauch to Business, than from
Business to a Debauch; and he never fatigu'd himself, but dispatch'd the
greatest Affairs with so much Ease as if they were only a Diversion. He
lov'd to banter, but did not always make use of the Terms suitable to his
Character; and Persons who did not dare to answer him again, were commonly
the Butts of his Raillery. He was polite when he had a mind to it, but in
the general Course of his Behaviour he carry'd an Air fitter for a Captain
of Dragoons than for a Marshal and a Prime Minister. He never did a thing
for any body without some View; he scrupl'd neither Cunning nor even
Perjury, and provided he could gain his Ends, all ways were alike fair to
him. All his Life-time he took care to do his own
Business<!--192.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
first, and
then his Master's the King's; and I question whether I do him any
Injustice if I say that he was the King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Minister, much more
than the King of <i>Poland</i>'s.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is all that I have to say to you concerning Count <i>Flemming</i>. I
have told you very nakedly what I always thought of him, and I don't
believe that I have mistaken his Character. Be this as it will, my
Decision is of too little weight to do either Good or Harm; the Publick
will always judge of him according to their best Information. I proceed
now with the Narrative of my Travels.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After I had set out from <i>Dresden</i> I went to <i>Altenbourg</i> in hopes of
finding the Court of <i>Gotha</i> there, which I had been told, intended to
spend the Remainder of the fine Season there; but it was set out the Night
before for <i>Gotha</i>, where I hope to see it to-morrow.</p>

<p>The City of <span class="smcap">Altenbourg</span> is the Capital of a County of that Name, of which
the Duke of <i>Saxe-Gotha</i> is the Sovereign. This Prince has a Palace there
which makes a handsome appearance, but I shall say nothing more of it
because I neglected to go and see it. The Peasants of the County of
<i>Altenbourg</i> are the richest in <i>Germany</i>, and may almost vye with those
of <i>Holland</i>. I have been assur'd that some of them have given 20 or 30000
Crowns in Marriage with their Daughters; and like the <i>Dutch</i> Peasants,
they take care to match them to none but the Sons of substantial Farmers.</p>

<p>As I left <i>Altenbourg</i> I came upon a fine Causey with a Row of Trees on
each side, which brought me to the Frontiers of the County. I afterwards
fell into very bad Roads all the way to <i>Leipsic</i>, where I stay'd but a
very few Hours, and proceeded the same day to <span class="smcap">Mersebourg</span>. This City was
much more considerable formerly than now. It was
the<!--193.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
See of a Bishop, but
was seculariz'd by the Treaty of <i>Passaw</i> in favour of the House of
<i>Saxony</i>. Its Situation is charming, with Gardens and Meadows all round
it, and its Walls are wash'd by the River <i>Sala</i>. The great Church which
was formerly a Cathedral is a <i>Gothic</i> Building, where there is a stately
Tomb of the Emperor <i>Rodolph</i> of <i>Schwartzbourg</i>, who died after he had
lost one Hand in a Battle he fought with the Emperor <i>Henry</i> IV. with whom
he was Competitor. This Prince a few Moments before he expir'd, took up
his Hand that was cut off, and holding it up to those who were about him,
said to them, <i>Behold this Hand; 'tis the same that I lifted up when I
promis'd Faith and Allegiance to my Emperor and Lord; but by your Advice
and Instigation I have not kept my Promise to him, for which you will one
day give an account to God.</i> Some time after this unfortunate Prince's
Death, the Emperor <i>Henry</i> IV. coming to <i>Mersebourg</i> and taking a view of
<i>Rodolphus's</i> Tomb, of which he admir'd the Magnificence, certain
Flatterers told him that the Tomb ought to be destroy'd as too pompous for
a Rebel; but the Emperor scorning such a pitiful Revenge, made answer,
<i>Wou'd to God that all my Enemies were thus pompously interr'd</i>.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Mersebourg</i> is the Residence of a Duke of the House of
<i>Saxony</i>, who is Sovereign of all the Country that formerly constituted
the Bishoprick, which enables him to keep a splendid Court<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. The next
day after my Arrival I had the Honour to pay him my Compliments, and had a
very satisfactory Reception. The Prince conducted me into a Hall which was
hung with Bass-Viols from the Bottom to the Top, in the same manner as an
Arsenal is with Helmets and Breast-Plates. In the middle of the Hall there
was a Viol which
was<!--194.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
distinguish'd from the rest. It reach'd up to the
very Cieling, and there was a Ladder set, which such as had the Curiosity
to take a particular View of it were oblig'd to ascend, for surely it was
the most stately Instrument of the kind that ever was made. The Duke made
me take particular notice of it, and was pleas'd with the Admiration which
I express'd of it. He regal'd me also with some Airs upon another
Bass-Viol which he call'd his <i>Favorite</i>, and which was but one fourth
part as big as the other.</p>

<p>After this Concert I din'd with the Duke and Duchess. This Princess is the
Daughter of the late Prince of <i>Nassau-Idstein</i>, than whom there cannot be
a more amiable Lady. She has an Air of Mildness, Goodness and Prudence
diffused over all her Features; and her Wit is of the same Stamp as her
Beauty, amiable without Parade and Ostentation. Some of her Courtiers
assur'd me, that her Mind is as charming as her Person. If that be true,
which I am loth to doubt of, this Princess deserves a more splendid
Fortune than what she enjoys.</p>

<p>After Dinner, I was one at a Match of Quadrille with the Duchess, and at
night there was dancing, and I never saw any body dance with a better
Grace than this Princess. The Ball held till the Night was far advanced,
when there was a grand Supper, which was no sooner over than I took leave
of the Duke and Duchess and retir'd to my Quarters, with a design to set
out in a few Hours and proceed in my Journey. At my Lodging I found a
Gentleman from the Duke, who said to me, 'That as he was passing by he saw
my Men packing up my things, and that therefore he came in purely to wish
me a good Journey. He assured me that he had a secret Kindness for me;
that I might safely take his Word; that he was Sincerity it self; and that
he wish'd 500000 Devils might twist his Neck if he was not heartily my
Friend:<!--195.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
And to give you proofs of it, <i>said he</i>, I will treat you with
some Trifle, such as a Dram of Anniseed, Orange-Water, or Ratasia. Upon my
word my Apothecary has what is choice good; he lives but at the end of the
Street; Come, I will shew you the way to his House.'</p>

<p>While he harangu'd me in this manner he reel'd, being so drunk that he
cou'd not stand. I thank'd him therefore for his Love, and told him that I
did not drink Drams, but that if he had a mind to any Liquor of that sort,
I would send for some for him; and I bid my Landlord fetch it. The
Apothecary, as ill luck would have it, was not yet got up. 'Soho, here,
<i>said my new Friend</i>, there is nothing to drink but Aquavitæ; here,
Landlord, a Glass of Brandy, Pipes and Tobacco. You must have something,
<i>said he</i>, to be doing.' Every thing he call'd for being brought, my
Gentleman drank two or three Glasses of Brandy, and smoak'd as many Pipes
of Tobacco. I hoped to see him tumble down, and by consequence to get rid
of him, when he took it into his head to call for some Dishes of Tea that
I had order'd to be made for my self, and which made him so sober that he
recover'd his Reason. I laid hold of this happy Interval (for I heard him
calling out for Brandy, which I apprehended would occasion a Relapse) and
talk'd to him about his Master's Bass-Viols; upon which, without much
Intreaty, he said to me, 'You know, Sir, that every Man almost has his
particular Whim, Princes as well as private Persons. One is an Admirer of
Magnificence, another of Troops, and a third of Mistresses. As for my
august Master, his Fancy runs only on Bass-Viols, and whoever sollicits
him for an Employment or any other Favour, can't do better than to
accommodate his Arsenal with one of these Instruments. That very large
one, <i>said he</i>, which you saw in the Room where all his Viols are, was
<!--196.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>presented
to him by one who wanted to be a Privy-Counsellor; his Petition
was granted, and had he ask'd for any thing else he might have had it.'
This officious Gentleman told me a great many other Particulars which let
me into the very Chronicle of the Court of <i>Mersebourg</i>; but I don't
trouble you with it, because the Truth is not to be told at all times.</p>

<p>My Equipage being ready, I set out for <span class="smcap">Naumbourg</span>, where I arrived at Noon.
This City was formerly the See of a Bishop. Its ancient Cathedral is still
standing, and tho' <i>Lutheran</i>, has a Chapter and Canons who must prove
their Nobility both by the Father's side and Mother's side, by sixteen
Descents. When this Bishoprick was seculariz'd it was said that no
Catholic Prince could ever be possess'd of this State. Therefore when the
last Duke of <i>Saxe-Zeits</i>, Administrator of <i>Naumbourg</i>, turn'd Catholic,
the King of <i>Poland</i> as eldest of the <i>Saxon</i> Family and Executor of the
<i>Pacta</i> or Conventions made between the Princes of that Family, took
possession of <i>Naumbourg</i>. The Duke's being reconciled to the <i>Lutheran</i>
Communion was to no purpose, the King did not restore his Dominions to
him, but still possesses them, tho' he is more a Catholic than the Duke of
<i>Zeits</i> perhaps ever was. You know that this Prince has left a Nephew who
wou'd have been his Heir, if he had not been a Catholic and a Priest. This
is the Prince who, I acquainted you from <i>Dresden</i>, was Bishop of
<i>Konigsgratz</i> in <i>Bohemia</i>. He was born a <i>Lutheran</i>, as are all those of
his Family. His Uncle the Cardinal of <i>Saxe</i>, Brother to the Duke of
<i>Zeits</i>, made him embrace the Roman Catholic Religion when he was very
young, and afterwards persuaded him to enter into Ecclesiastical Orders,
by which step he deprived his Nephew of the glorious Prerogative of being
a Sovereign Prince, and transferred
his<!--197.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Rights to the King of <i>Poland</i>
his distant Cousin.</p>

<p><i>Naumbourg</i> is famous for its Fairs, which next to those of <i>Leipsic</i>, are
the most considerable in <i>Saxony</i>. The Suburbs of this City are almost all
Vineyards; but why, I know not, for the Wine is so detestably bad, that
they give it away in a manner for nothing.</p>

<p>Finding nothing at <i>Naumbourg</i> which was worth my while to stay there for,
I only chang'd Horses and came hither. As one approaches this Place, we
meet with Corn-Fields and Hop-Grounds instead of Vines, and the Country
rises into Hills, so that one does not see the Town of <span class="smcap">Weimar</span> till we are
just upon it. The City, which is not more considerable than <i>Naumbourg</i>,
is the Residence of the Duke of <i>Saxe-Weimar</i>, who has a Palace here which
does not want for Magnificence, and tho' unfinish'd, has an air of
Grandeur. The Connoisseurs in Architecture highly extol the grand
Stair-Case there, which two Persons may ascend and descend at the same
time without meeting one another, and yet always keeping each other in
view. It consists of two Flights of Stairs upon one Spindle, laid one over
the other in the same Well of a square Form. The Curious who have observ'd
it, admire it, because there are few such to be seen.</p>

<p>The great Hall which is an oval, is beautiful, but not lightsome enough.
There are the Pictures of all the Dukes of <i>Saxe-Weimar</i> at full length,
from the first Duke that ever was down to the Father of the present. They
are all drawn on Horseback, and done by no mean Hand.</p>

<p>In the same Palace is the Duke's Library, which tho' not very large,
consists of sundry scarce Books. 'Tis open twice a week, when the Curious
are not only permitted to peruse them, but even to borrow them, upon
leaving a Note with the Librarian.</p>

<!--198.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Weimar</i> spends very little Time in his Capital, but commonly
resides at a Seat which he has caus'd to be built about a League out of
Town. He has given it the Name of <i>Belle-Vue</i>, because of the fine
Prospect which it commands from the Apartments of the first Story. The
House is small and not very commodious, so that the chief Beauty of it is
its Situation, which is very charming. The Gardens which are begun upon
very good Plans will be beautiful when finish'd, as well as the
Pheasant-Walk and Menagerie where there are Turkeys and all sorts of Fowl.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Weimar's</i> Name is <i>Ernest-Augustus</i>: He is the eldest of the
<i>Ernestine</i> Branch which lost the Electorate when <i>Charles</i> V. was
Emperor. He marry'd a Princess of <i>Anhalt-Cothen</i>, who I have been told,
was a Lady of distinguish'd Merit. She died and left him a Son and three
Daughters.</p>

<p>The young Prince is about ten Years of age<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. He can neither hear nor
pronounce well, and is withal of a very tender Constitution. The
Physicians say it signifies nothing, and that as he grows up he will
acquire a Freedom of Speech. But I question it, and am apt to think rather
that those Disciples of <i>Æsculapius</i> will send him into the other World.
The only Hopes of any Male Issue of <i>Weimar</i> are founded upon this Child.
The Duke of <i>Saxe-Eysenach</i> who is the next a-kin has no Children; so that
the Dominions of <i>Weimar</i> and <i>Eysenach</i> too are ready to devolve to the
Family of <i>Saxe-Gotha</i>. The Duke of <i>Weimar's</i> Subjects teaze him very
much to marry, but the Prince does not seem to be in a Humour to satisfy
them; for I have often heard him say that he can't bear the mention of
Marriage.</p>

<!--199.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>No body presumes to go to <i>Belle-Vue</i> without being sent for, except only
on <i>Mondays</i> when poor People are permitted to go thither with their
Petitions which they deliver to the Secretary, and he gives them to the
Duke. Persons of Quality, whether Foreigners or others, that have a mind
to speak with the Duke, apply for it to the Marshal of the Court, but are
seldom admitted to an Audience.</p>

<p>The Duke has rarely any other Company at <i>Belle-Vue</i> but two young Ladies
whom he calls his Maids of Honour, and three young Women, Citizens
Daughters, who go by the Name of his Chamber-Maids; a Major of his Troops,
and the Officer of his Guard, who is a Lieutenant or an Ensign. I had
forgot to mention the Baron <i>de Bruhl</i>, who is the Duke's Favourite and
his Master of the Horse.</p>

<p>'Tis with these Persons that the Prince passes his Time. He wakes early in
the Morning, but makes it late before he rises; for he takes his Tea in
Bed, and sometimes plays on the Violin. At other times he sends for his
Architects and Gardeners, with whom he amuses himself in drawing of Plans.
His Ministers also come to him while he is in Bed to talk upon Business.
About Noon he gets up, and as soon as he is dress'd, sees his Guard mount,
which consists of 33 Men, commanded by a Lieutenant or an Ensign. He
exercises his Soldiers himself, and corrects them too when they commit any
Fault. This done he takes the Air, and at two or three o'clock sits down
to Table, where the two Maids of Honour, the Master of the Horse, the
Major, the Officer of the Guard, and even Foreigners if any happen to be
there, are of the Company. The Dinner holds a long while, and 'tis
sometimes three, four, and five Hours before they rise from Table. The
Glass never stands still hardly, and the Duke talks a great deal, but the
Conversation is commonly on Subjects that are not very agreeable. When
Dinner is over they
drink<!--200.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Coffee, after which the Duke retires for a few
Minutes, and then plays at Quadrille with his two young Ladies and the
Major; but sometimes he does nothing but smoak Tobacco, and he often
retires to his Chamber where he amuses himself with Drawing or else
playing on the Violin till he goes to Bed.</p>

<p>There scarce a Week passes but the Duke gives an Invitation at least once
or twice to all the Persons of Quality of the Court, and all the Officers
of his Troops, at which time there are two great Tables spread, where they
dine, play, sup, and afterwards dance till next Day.</p>

<p>The Duke's Troops consist of a Battalion of 700 Men, a Squadron of 180
Troopers, and a Company of Cadets on horseback. His Infantry consists of
pick'd Men. Since the famous <i>Bernard de Weimar</i> who was Pensioner to
<i>Lewis</i> XIII. King of <i>France</i>, no Duke of <i>Weimar</i> had so many Troops,
and really they must be chargeable to the Duke whose Revenues 'tis said
don't exceed 400000 Crowns. This Prince has made a Treaty with the King of
<i>Poland</i>, whereby he engages to assist the King with his Battalion
whenever his Majesty thinks it necessary for his Service; in which Case
the King promises to give that Battalion the same Pay as he does his own
Troops. Mean time the Duke is obliged to clothe them all according to the
Pattern which is sent to him from <i>Dresden</i>; and indeed their Clothes are
very rich, especially those of the Officers and Cadets, which are so
bedaub'd with Gold and Silver Lace, that a Foreigner who comes to <i>Weimar</i>
cannot but admire it.</p>

<p>The Duke's Family is very numerous, for besides the Prince his Son and the
three Princesses his Daughters, he has a Sister, and a Mother-in-law, who
is a Princess of <i>Hesse-Hombourg</i>: Mean time
he<!--201.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
has a numerous Court, and
may boast that some of them are Persons of very great Merit.</p>

<p>The Gentleman who is at the Head of Affairs is the Baron <i>de Reinbabe</i>,
who has the Title of President of the Council of State. He is a Person of
a good Family, in <i>Silesia</i>, has very great Abilities, and withal so much
Good-nature and Modesty as are seldom to be met with. When he was young he
travell'd very much abroad, where he learnt what was valuable in every
Country that he came to. He speaks several Languages well, is a great
Historian, a learned Civilian, and a good Poet. Notwithstanding the
Business that goes thro' his Hands, and his Care of a numerous Family, he
is always almost at his Studies, and never better pleas'd than when he is
in his Library; yet he is no Enemy to Pleasures, but enjoys them without
abandoning himself to them, and takes them as they fall in his way without
pursuing 'em. To finish his Character I will add what was said of him by a
Prince who knew him intimately: <i>If Probity was intirely lost in the rest
of Mankind</i>, said he to me, <i>I think I shou'd be sure to find it again in
the Baron</i> de Reinbabe.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Schmiedel</i> is Marshal of the Court and Director of the
military Chest. He is a Person of great Piety, whose Aspect is not indeed
the most engaging, yet a very good Man to have to do with. He is a sincere
Friend, loves to do a kind Thing, is exact in the Duties of his Offices,
an Enemy to Vice, and very much attach'd to the Interests of his Master,
tho' he does not always please him because he has not the Talent of
Dissimulation so necessary at Courts.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Studenitz</i> a <i>Silesian</i> is a Privy-Counsellor, and President
of the Chamber. He was formerly in the Service of the Duke of
<i>Saxe-Barbi</i>, and afterwards he enter'd into that of the Duke of
<i>Saxe-Hilburgshausen</i>, whose Finances
he<!--202.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
directed for several Years, in
which he acquired a Reputation, and came to <i>Weimar</i> where he was
continued in the same Employment. He is a Gentleman of very great Learning
and Integrity, and having travell'd a long time in his Youth, very well
knows how to carry himself.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Hering</i> is of a noble Family in the Country of <i>Anhalt-Cothen</i>. He
is the Duke's Aulic Counsellor, a Gentleman of Worth, and both Learned and
Polite. He is on the point of leaving this Court, which will be a Loss to
the Duke that he will not easily repair.</p>

<p>M. <i>de Bruhl</i> the Duke's Master of the Horse and Favourite, is a <i>Saxon</i>.
His Birth, good Qualities, and especially his sweet Temper render him very
worthy of a Sovereign's Favour. Yet I doubt whether, notwithstanding so
much Merit, he has a firm Footing in the Duke's Friendship; he has too
much Candor, too much Sincerity, and is too zealous to do Services; and
perhaps also too much attach'd to the Interests and Honour of his Master:
for tho' these Qualities have the Appearance of Virtues, yet they are
sometimes Errors in the Eyes of Princes.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, have I given you the Names of the most distinguish'd Persons at
the Court of <i>Weimar</i>. I set out to-morrow for <i>Gotha</i>. I hope for a Line
from you at <i>Wurtzbourg</i>, and don't propose to write again to you till I
know whether you are living or dead.</p>

<h2>LETTER VII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Gotha, Sept. 9, 1732.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I set out from <i>Weimar</i> at 5 o'clock in the Morning, and by eight was at
<i>Erfurt</i>, where I walk'd about an Hour, and came at Noon to <i>Gotha</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis all a flat Country abounding with Corn. In time of Rain the Roads are
so bad that sometimes it takes up a whole Day to come from <i>Erfurt</i> to
<i>Gotha</i>. <span class="smcap">Erfurt</span> is a City belonging to the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>, is the
Capital of <i>Thuringia</i>, and may be rank'd among those of the second Class
in <i>Germany</i>. Its Inhabitants are almost all <i>Lutherans</i>, yet the
principal Churches belong to the Catholics. <i>Erfurt</i> is fortified with
good Ramparts, and by a Castle on a Hill which absolutely commands the
Town. There is always a good Garison in the Place, which consists of the
Emperor's Soldiers and those of <i>Mentz</i>; and the Elector has a Governor
here with the Title of <i>Stadtholder</i>, who presides in the Regency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gotha</span>, which is not near so big as <i>Erfurt</i>, is a City situate in the
middle of a fine fruitful Plain, so that which way soever one approaches
it, one always perceives the Castle or Palace of the Duke, which stands on
an Eminence by itself, and has a Prospect of a vast Extent of Country.
This Castle, which is one of the biggest in <i>Germany</i>, was built by
<i>Ernest</i> Duke of <i>Gotha</i>, surnamed the <i>Pious</i>;
who<!--204.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
caused both that and
the Town to be encompassed with Ditches and Ramparts. To the Glory of this
Prince, he undertook and finished these Great Works, at a time when
<i>Germany</i> was so impoverished by intestine Wars that few of its Princes
were able to erect Palaces<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>As of all the <i>Saxon</i> Princes of the <i>Ernestine</i> Branch, the Duke of
<i>Gotha</i> is the most powerful, so his Court is of all the <i>Saxon</i> Courts
next to that of <i>Dresden</i>, the most Numerous and the most Magnificent.</p>

<!--205.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless the Subjects of the Duke of <i>Gotha</i><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> are the least
burthen'd with Taxes of any in <i>Germany</i>. To this Prince's wise Management
of his Finances is owing not only his own Happiness, but that of his
People too, by whom he is ador'd; and really he treats them more like a
Father, than a Sovereign; and never makes them sensible of his Power, but
when he is to do them Justice. He is a kind good Master, easy of Access,
temperate in his way of Living, gives very great Application to the
Affairs of his Government, loves Reading, understands Books, and knows
every thing which a Prince ought to be acquainted with. As to his Person,
he is handsome and comely; is civil in his Deportment, but reserv'd; and
therefore seldom speaks to Strangers, if he can help it; but endeavours
first of all to know those he has Business with, and when he has found out
their Character, talks with them upon such Subjects as he thinks they are
best acquainted with. He keeps regular Hours, rises at seven o'clock,
first spends an Hour in Prayer, and the reading of some pious Treatise;
and then gets himself dress'd, and gives Audience to his Ministers, or to
other Persons that desire it. At Noon he dines with the Duchess his Wife,
the Princes his Children, and other Persons of Distinction; stays about an
Hour and a half at Table, and then takes a Walk in the Gardens of the
Palace, or if the Weather does not permit, he employs himself in his
Closet, or spends the Time in reading till five o'clock. Then he goes to
the House of some Person of Distinction at his Court where all the
Nobility have an Assembly, and plays at Ombre, after which he returns to
his Palace, sups in the manner that he din'd, and at nine o'clock retires.</p>

<p>There is a Drawing-Room at Court three times a Week when the Company meets
in a great
Hall,<!--206.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
where they make Parties at Ombre and Piquet. At seven
o'clock a large Table is spread, which is free for all the Company. Then a
Carver cuts up the Victuals, which are handed to that, and to all the
Gaming-Tables that are cover'd with Napkins. Those who don't play may sit
down at what Table they like best. The Duke, the Duchess, or the Princes,
generally do Foreigners the Honour to admit them to their Table. During
the Supper there is a Concert of Music, and at nine o'Clock all the
Company retires.</p>

<p>The Duke by his Marriage with <i>Magdalen-Augusta</i> of <i>Anhalt-Zerbst</i>, has
seven Sons and two Daughters<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>: The eldest is the Hereditary Prince, who
has been twice in <i>Paris</i>, and once in <i>Italy</i>, <i>England</i>, <i>Holland</i>,
<i>Denmark</i>, <i>Sweden</i>, and at all the Courts of <i>Germany</i>, in which Travels
he has acquir'd a great deal of Politeness and valuable Knowledge. I had
the Honour of making my Compliments to him both at <i>Paris</i>, and the
<i>Hague</i>, and found him of such a Temper as induces me to think that the
Subjects of <i>Gotha</i> will be as happy hereafter under his Government, as
they are under that of the Duke his Father. He was lately married to his
Cousin-German <i>Louisa-Dorothea</i> of <i>Saxe-Meinungen</i>, a very lovely young
Princess, who, with all her Graces and Charms, has abundance of
Good-nature and Modesty<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>The Duke has all the Great Officers common to other Sovereigns. The Count
<i>de Ronaw</i> is Great Marshal, and the chief Man at Court. They give him
here the Character of Favourite; whether he is such I know not, but this I
know, that he is
not<!--207.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
unworthy of it. I was very well acquainted with him
at <i>Ratisbon</i> in 1720; he was not then in any Place, and expressed a
Friendship for me; and now that I see him here in a Post, I find him the
same Man as at <i>Ratisbon</i>, always a Friend to his Friends; which for a
Favourite is a very great Character.</p>

<p>The Duke's Revenues are computed at a Million of Crowns a year, with which
he maintains near 3000 Men of regular Troops. His Family is large and his
Livery fine; his Guards are very well cloath'd; his Table is serv'd with
more Delicacy than Profusion; his Palace is well furnish'd; every body
punctually paid; and no body dissatisfied.</p>

<p>I don't mention the Library to you, nor the Chamber of Rarities, because I
am not yet well enough inform'd of such Things there as are worth
observing. I propose to take another Round before I go hence, and shall
not fail to transmit to you what Observations I shall make there. Mean
time, I am, <i>&amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>When I came hither I had the very great Pleasure to find your Letters, and
to hear that you enjoy perfect Health. Continue, I beseech you, to write
to me; that being the only Means by which you can persuade me what I wish
to be convinced of more than any thing in the World, that my Letters are
acceptable to you.</p>

<p>I have been in one of the most disagreeable Roads in all <i>Germany</i>; and
tho' the Country abounds with Provisions of all sorts, I had like to have
been famished in the Public Houses.</p>

<p>From <i>Gotha</i>, I went to <span class="smcap">Eysenach</span>, thinking to pass a few Days at that
Court, but I found the<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Duke sick, and the Hereditary Prince and
Princess<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> absent, so that I had only my Labour for my Pains.</p>

<!--209.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>As the Town of <i>Eysenach</i> offers nothing at all to View which is worth a
Traveller's Attention, I set out the same Day for <span class="smcap">Fulde</span>, where I arrived
the next. You know, that this City is the Capital of the Principality of
<i>Fulde</i>, the Sovereign of which is an Abbot, a Prince of the Empire, and
Chancellor to the Empress. The present Sovereign is <i>Adolphus</i> Baron of
<i>Bahlberg</i>, who was chose by the Chapter of the Abbey Church in 1726, in
the room of <i>Constantine</i> Baron of <i>Buthler</i>, who died suddenly, and not
without suspicion of Poison. <i>Fulde</i> is a dirty little Town open on all
sides, and has nothing remarkable but the Abbey Church, and the Prince's
Palace, which are two Freestone Buildings that make a very grand
Appearance. The Apartments of the Palace are very richly furnish'd. The
last Abbot being a Man of good Understanding and great Views, caused this
Palace to be so adorn'd as to demonstrate the Wealth of the Abbey.</p>

<p>The Prince Abbot has a Grand Marshal, a Master of the Horse, a Marshal of
the Court, several Privy and Aulic Counsellors, a Number of Gentlemen, a
Company of Horse-Guards well cloathed and well mounted, a Regiment of Foot
Guards, eight Pages, a Number of Footmen, and several Sets of Horses. He
gives a rich Livery, and in a word, his Houshold is spruce and
magnificent. There are very few Sovereigns in <i>Germany</i> whose Table is
better served; for there is plenty of every thing, particularly delicious
Wines, of which they tipple to such Excess that in a very little time they
are not capable of distinguishing their Liquor. There are, I believe, the
hardest Drinkers here in <i>Europe</i>; and I being on the other hand but a
Milksop, thought that <i>Fulde</i> was not a Country for me to pitch my Tent
in. I dined with the Prince, went home drunk to my Quarters, slept sound,
and next
day<!--210.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
set out for <i>Wurtzbourg</i>, where I am happily arriv'd after
having gone through such horrible bad Ways, and met with such dismal
Lodging, that I wish my Enemies were but condemned to travel this Road
four times a Year.</p>

<p>Here I make myself amends for the Mortification which I met with coming
hither. <span class="smcap">Wurtzbourg</span> is a considerable City though not very large. The
<i>Main</i> divides it into two Parts. It is the Residence of the Prince Bishop
of <i>Wurtzbourg</i> Duke of <i>Franconia</i>. The Person who now enjoys that great
Dignity is <i>Christopher-Francis de Houtten</i><a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. He was elected by the
Chapter to succeed <i>John Philip Francis</i> Count de <i>Schonborn</i>, who was one
of the greatest and most magnificent Prelates that perhaps ever fill'd the
Episcopal See of <i>Wurtzbourg</i>. This Prince, in the five Years time that he
has been Bishop, has done more things for the Embellishment of
<i>Wurtzbourg</i> than ten of his Predecessors put together. He has furnished
one Part of the Town with new Fortifications, and has laid the Basis of a
stately Palace, which will be one of the greatest, the compleatest and
most regular Fabrics that we have in <i>Germany</i>; he having for that end
consulted the most skilful Architects, and sent for the most celebrated
Sculptors from <i>Italy</i>. As he was a passionate Admirer of the Arts and
Sciences, and perfectly understood them, especially Architecture; he chose
the best Parts of all the Designs that were presented to him, and from
them he compos'd the Plan of the Work, which was executed with such
diligence that in four Years time two thirds of the Building were rooft.
His unexpected Death put a stop for a while to this Great Work. The
<!--211.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>present
Bishop took it in hand again, but after having made considerable
Alterations in those great and magnificent Projects, the Work advances so
slowly that when it will be finished no body knows.</p>

<p>The deceased Bishop <i>Schonborn</i> has also caused a Chapel to be built near
the Metropolitan Church, which he has lined with very uncommon Marble
brought for the purpose from <i>Italy</i> at a very great Expence. Brass,
Gilding, and every thing that can render a Chapel superb, has been
employed in it in a very curious manner. This stately Edifice is as yet
imperfect, and will require great Sums to finish it. As it was designed
for the Burial-Place of the Bishop and his Family, it is to be presum'd
that the House of <i>Schonborn</i>, now so rich and so powerful, will not
suffer a Monument to lie unfinish'd which is to perpetuate the remembrance
of its Grandeur.</p>

<p>The Great Hospital founded by a Bishop whose Name was <i>Julius</i>, is worth
seeing. 'Tis a stately Building, which looks more like the Palace of a
Prince than a Hospital. Four hundred Persons of both Sexes are maintained
in it. There are two fine Halls which are particularly made use of upon
<i>Holy Thursday</i>. In the one, the Bishop performs the Ceremony of washing
the Feet of the Poor, who are afterwards sumptuously feasted in it; and in
the other, he regales his Chapter, and all his Family.</p>

<p>The Castle stands upon an Eminence on the other side of the River which we
pass over a Stone Bridge, adorn'd like that of St. <i>Angelo</i> at <i>Rome</i>,
with twelve fine Statues representing so many Saints. This Castle is a
strong Place, and entirely commands the Town. The Form of it is quite
irregular, it consisting of several Buildings erected by several Bishops.
Those Prelates always liv'd in it, till the last, who, while he was
building a new Palace in the Town, lodged in a neighbouring Gentleman's
<!--212.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>House,
from whence he could see how the Work went on. The Apartments of
the old Castle are spacious and noble. I found in them all that Furniture
with which they were adorn'd for the Reception of the Archduchess
<i>Mary-Elizabeth</i>, when that Princess came to <i>Wurtzbourg</i> in her way to
the Government of the <i>Netherlands</i>. I have not seen richer Furniture at
the Palace of any Prince of the Empire.</p>

<p>In this Castle there are two things that are well worth seeing; the
Arsenal and the Vault; the one full of all the Stores invented by <i>Mars</i>
and <i>Bellona</i>, for the Destruction of Mankind, and the other furnish'd
with every thing to satiate the Thirst of an Army of Drunkards. If ever
you come hither and should have the Curiosity to visit these Magazines of
<i>Mars</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>, I advise you to begin with the Arsenal, especially
if you can get some Courtier to go with you; for these Gentlemen, tho'
very civil, think, that the least thing which a Foreigner ought to do for
them is to forfeit his Reason to them in this Vault. I am sure, I speak by
dear Experience. Three days ago I told the Bishop that I had a mind to see
the Castle. This Prince was so complaisant as to order one of his
Gentlemen to go with me. My honest Companion fearing, 'tis like, that a
Conversation <i>tete-a-tete</i> would be too melancholy, chose two Topers to
bear us Company, whom <i>Silenus</i> would not have disown'd for his Children.
Being a stranger to the Virtues for which those Gentlemen were eminent, I
put my self entirely under their Direction without the least Apprehension
of my Misfortune. When they had shewed me the Apartments, the Arsenal,
Fortifications, and every thing, they carried me at last into the Vault,
which I found illuminated like a Chapel wherein I was to lie in State; and
indeed, my Funeral Obsequies were perform'd in Pomp, for the Glasses
served<!--213.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
instead of Bells, and Torrents of Wine gush'd out instead of
Tears: At length, after the Service was over, two of the Prince's
<i>Heydukes</i> carry'd me to a Coach, and from thence to Bed; that was my
Tomb. Yesterday I rose again, but scarce know at this Moment whether I am
quite come to myself. 'Tis true that this does not give me much Concern,
for ever since I have been here, I have followed the laudable Custom of
getting drunk twice a day. You perceive that I am improv'd by my Travels,
and that I am apt enough to learn the pretty Manners of the Countries
where I make any Stay. I fancy that you will find me very much alter'd for
the better. There is nothing that accomplishes a Man so much as
travelling; judge you of this by the Life which I lead here.</p>

<p>I rise at ten o'clock, my Lungs very much inflam'd with the Wine I drank
the Night before: I take a large Dose of Tea, dress myself, and then go to
make my Compliments to the Bishop. The Baron <i>de Pechtelsheim</i> the Marshal
of the Court invites me to dine with the Prince: He promises, nay, and
sometimes swears too that I shall not drink. At Noon we sit down to Table.
The Bishop does me the honour to drink two or three Healths to me. The
Baron <i>de Zobel</i>, Master of the Horse, and the Baron <i>de Pechtelsheim</i>,
toast the same number to me, and I am under a necessity of drinking to no
less than fourteen Persons at the Table; so that I am drown'd in Liquor
before I have din'd. When the Company rises, I wait on the Prince to his
Chamber-Door, where he retires, and I think to do the same, but I find an
Embargo put upon me in the Antichamber by the Master of the Horse, and the
Marshal of the Court, who with great Bumpers in their Hands drink the
Prince's Health to me, and <i>Prosperity for ever to the most laudable
Chapter of <span class="f">Wurtzbourg</span></i>. I protest to them that I am
the<!--214.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Bishop's most
humble Servant, and that I have a very great Veneration for the most
laudable Chapter, but that to drink their Healths wou'd destroy mine, and
therefore I beg they wou'd excuse my pledging them; but I may as well talk
to the Wind; these two Healths must be drank, or I shall be reckon'd no
Friend to the Prince and his Chapter. If this were all my Task I shou'd be
well off; but then comes M. <i>de Zobel</i>, one of the most intrepid Carousers
of the Age, who squeezes me by the Hand, and with an Air and Tone of
perfect Cordiality, says to me, <i>You love our Prince so well that you
can't refuse drinking to the Prosperity of the illustrious Family of
<span class="f">Houtten</span></i>. And when he has made this moving Speech, he takes off a great
Glass to witness his Zeal for the Life of his Master; after which an
officious <i>Heyduke</i> brings me a Glass, and being infected with the Goust
that prevails at this Court, assures me that this Wine cannot possibly do
me Harm, because 'tis the very same that the Prince drinks. By a
Persuasion, founded on so just an Inference, I have the Courage to venture
on t'other Glass, which is no sooner drank but I reel, and can drink no
more; when in order to finish me M. <i>de Pechtelsheim</i>, one of the
honestest Gentlemen living, but the staunchest Wine-bibber that I know,
accosts me with a Smile and says, <i>Come</i>, dear Baron, <i>one Glass more to
better Acquaintance</i>. I conjure him to give me Quarter, but he embraces
me, kisses me, and calls me <i>Herr Bruder</i>, (his dear Brother.) How can a
Man withstand such tender Compliments! At last I put myself in a fit
Posture to run away; I sneak off, steal down the Steps as well as I can,
and squeeze myself into a Sedan which carries me home; where my People
drag me out like a dead Corpse, and fling me on a Bed, as if the next
thing was to lay me out. I sleep three or four hours, awake in a perfect
Maze, put
myself<!--215.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
to rights again, and prepare to make Visits, or to
receive them; but whichsoever I do, I presently find my self in such a
pickle again, that I cannot walk alone. There's no such thing as
Conversation here betwixt one Friend and another without the Bottle; so
that I am tempted to think the Inhabitants of this City are descended from
<i>Silenus</i>, and that the old Sot left them the Faculty of hard drinking for
a Legacy, as St. <i>Hubert</i> bequeath'd to his Family the power of curing a
Frenzy.</p>

<p>I din'd yesterday with the Reverend the <i>Scots Benedictine</i> Fryars, who
gave me a hearty Welcome, and an excellent sort of Liquor call'd <i>Stein
Wein</i>, or Stone-Wine, probably because it grows on a Rock; which is the
only time that I have departed from the Regimen I keep to here, I mean
that I was not drunk. The House of these <i>Benedictines</i> is one of the five
Houses which form a sort of a Republic in their Order, and which, without
depending on their General, chuse a President out of their number who has
the direction of all their Affairs. These five Houses are in five
different Towns, <i>viz.</i> at <i>Vienna</i> in <i>Austria</i>, at <i>Ratisbon</i>,
<i>Wurtzbourg</i>, at <i>Doway</i> in <i>Flanders</i>, and at <i>Dieulegarde</i>, near
<i>Pont-a-Mousson</i> in <i>Lorrain</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Benedictines</i> put me in mind of the Reverend Fathers the <i>Jesuits</i>,
who have a very fine House in this City: These are they who are Directors
of the University, and instruct the Youth with a Zeal which cannot but
confound their Enemies.</p>

<p>The Prince and Bishop lives in very great Splendor, and is one of the most
powerful of our Spiritual Sovereigns. His Dominion includes seventy
Bailywics, and his Country is the finest and fruitfullest in <i>Germany</i>.
The only thing that is scarce here is Money, and this is owing to their
want of Trade, and to the great number of Monks
and<!--216.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Priests who ingross
all to themselves. The Bishop has 50000 Crowns a-year for his Privy-Purse.
The Chamber is oblig'd to maintain him in every thing. It furnishes his
Wardrobe, his Table, and pays his Houshold and his Troops, which actually
consist of 3500 Men, who are commanded by General <i>Eib</i>, the Governour of
<i>Wurtzbourg</i>. In time of War the Bishop has no less than 10000.</p>

<p>The Court is numerous, and I can assure you that upon Festival-Days 'tis
very magnificent. On St. <i>Quilian</i>'s Day, who is the Patron of
<i>Wurtzbourg</i> and <i>Franconia</i>, the Bishop repairs with a great Train to the
Metropolitan Church. Six of the Bishop's Coaches, drawn each by six
Horses, begin the March, attended by twenty four Footmen and sixteen
Pages; and above fourscore Gentlemen richly dress'd walk before the
Bishop's Coach, guarded by two Files of Halbardiers. The Master of the
Horse and the Marshal of the Court walk by the sides of the Coach, the
latter bearing the Sword of the Duke of <i>Franconia</i> with the Point
uppermost; and the Coach is surrounded by <i>Heydukes</i>, and followed by a
company of Life-Guards.</p>

<p>The Bishop of <i>Wurtzbourg</i> has one Prerogative which the other Bishops
have not; for while he officiates, his Great Marshal bears the Sword of
the Duke of <i>Franconia</i> naked and upright till the Consecration of the
Elements, and then he puts it up in the Scabbard, and carries it before
the Prince with the Point downwards; which is a Distinction I take to be
altogether as extraordinary as that of the Abbot and Count <i>de Gemblours</i>,
the first Nobleman of the States of <i>Brabant</i>, who has the Privilege of
celebrating Mass with his Boots and Spurs on.</p>

<p>The Bishop's ordinary Expence is perfectly suitable to the Dignity of a
great Prince; and
his<!--217.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Table, which is commonly spread for eighteen
Guests, is serv'd with a Magnificence to the degree of Profusion; not that
this Prince affects Pomp, but because he is oblig'd to conform to the
antient establish'd Customs of his Court. This Prelate gives very great
Application to the Affairs of his Government, for which purpose he rises
early in the Morning: When he is dress'd he spends some time in Prayer,
and then confers with his Ministers, or with the Chiefs of the several
Tribunals. At ten o'clock he hears Mass, and afterwards goes to Council:
At Noon he dines, and after having sate an Hour and an half at Table, he
retires, and spends the Evening with his Family, which is numerous, and
compos'd of Persons of Worth. In Carnival-time he makes great
Entertainments twice or thrice a week for all the Nobility of
<i>Wurtzbourg</i>, and there is sometimes a Ball and even Masquerades at Court.
In the Winter-time Persons of Rank have Assemblies for Gaming; and during
the Carnival there's a Ball three times a week in a House kept by the
Undertaker, at which they bespeak Places beforehand, and where Foreigners
are admitted <i>gratis</i>. All this wou'd be pretty enough if the Company was
not sometimes disturb'd by People in Liquor, tho' 'tis true that such are
not very chagrining to the Natives, who are us'd to such Sights; and the
very Ladies, who elsewhere fly such Company, do not seem to have a staunch
Aversion to them. Foreigners have reason to applaud the Civilities both of
the Prince and his Courtiers. As for my own part I am infinitely oblig'd
for the Respect they have been pleas'd to shew to me. The Prince heaps his
Favours on me, and the Nobility their Courtesies. If it were not that one
is forc'd to drink hard, I shou'd like the Town very well. Two Days hence
I shall set out for <i>Anspach</i>,
and<!--218.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
from thence I shall go by the way of
<i>Nuremberg</i> and <i>Bareith</i> to <i>Prague</i>. I shall write to you by the very
first Opportunity: Mean time I am, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER IX.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Anspach, Sept. 29, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I came in one day from <i>Wurtzbourg</i> to <span class="smcap">Anspach</span>, which is twelve Miles, and
pass'd thro' two or three little Towns not worth naming. <i>Anspach</i> is the
Capital of the Margraviate so call'd, and the Residence of the Margrave of
<i>Brandenbourg</i>, Chief of the second Branch of that Family settled in
<i>Franconia</i>. 'Tis a small but pretty Town, and very well built. It has no
Fortifications, and is only shut in by Walls surrounded with Walks which
form a Bulwark. The Prince has a large Castle or Palace building here,
which when finish'd will be magnificent. The late Margrave, Father of the
present, had begun to build it according to the Models of an <i>Italian</i>
Architect; but as he did nothing to answer the Opinion conceiv'd by the
<i>Germans</i> that the <i>Italians</i> are the best Architects in the World,
perhaps because he was oblig'd to patch up old Walls for the sake of some
Rooms: Madame the Margravine Regent, Mother of the young Margrave,
continued what her Husband began, but changed the Architect, and makes use
of the Baron <i>de Zochau</i> to carry on those Works; who, tho' oblig'd to
conform to what was done by the <i>Italian</i>, has succeeded much better than
that Foreigner. Madame the Margravine Regent has
likewise<!--219.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
caus'd some
noble Gardens to be laid out; and this Princess spares no Cost for
embellishing the Town of <i>Anspach</i>.</p>

<p>The Margravine Regent<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> is of the Family of <i>Wurtenberg</i>, and may be
compar'd for Beauty with the finest Princesses in the World. Being left a
Widow at twenty nine Years of Age, she renounc'd all Pleasures, and
thought of nothing but the Education of her Son, and the Affairs of her
Regency; both of which Duties this Princess discharges in such a manner
that her Subjects bless her Government, and the young Margrave cannot but
have very great Obligations to her.</p>

<p>Madame the Margravine, besides a charming Person, has a sparkling Wit and
a solid Judgment, which she has taken care to cultivate by great reading,
and maintains by a Piety and Charity truly Christian. There is in all her
Actions such Politeness, and so much Good-nature, as gain her the hearts
of all Persons. In fine, without flattering this Princess, I can assure
you that her Life is a Pattern of Virtue. She is wean'd from all the
Vanities of the Age; she wears neither Gold nor Lace, and has given her
Diamonds, which were of very great value, to her Son. She keeps so retir'd
to her Apartment, that she is never seen but at Church, at Table, or when
she gives Audience; which she never refuses to any body unless when she is
tir'd. She is incessantly employ'd, and takes delight in it. She is her
own Minister, and her Counsellors are only the Executioners of her Orders.</p>

<p>'Tis pity that <i>Germany</i> is so soon like to lose a Princess who does her
Country so much Honour: The Margravine is in so declining a Condition
<!--220.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>that
there's no hopes of her Recovery. The Physicians have actually told
her so; but the Princess, far from being terrify'd at the sad Tidings,
receiv'd it like a Christian Heroine: <i>God gave me my Life</i>, said she to
her Physicians, <i>he will take it from me when he pleases, his Will be
done</i>. She continues to live in the way she always did; and the Approach
of Death, which she sees advancing to her with slow Pace, gives her no
Trouble nor Tremor; but submitting to the Decrees of Providence, she waits
with Resignation for that awful Moment which often makes the stoutest
Hearts tremble.</p>

<p>The young Margrave is actually at <i>Paris</i>, so that I cou'd have given you
no manner of Account of this Prince, if I had not had the Honour to see
him two Years ago. He was born the 12th of <i>May</i>, 1712. He is a handsome,
comely, lively Man, has an extraordinary Memory, and if Age matures his
Understanding, bids fair to be one day a Prince of a sublime Genius. His
Governour was M. <i>de Bremer</i>, a Gentleman of <i>Livonia</i>; and his Præceptor
M. <i>Neukirch</i><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, celebrated for several Essays in Poetry.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Reform which Madame the Margravine made in her Court
when she came to the Regency, 'tis still very numerous. The Count <i>de
Castel</i> is the first Man at this Court, and has the Title of Lord Steward.
His Lady commonly attends Madame the Margravine, and does the Offices of
Lady of Honour without affecting the Title. M. <i>de Bremer</i>, the Baron <i>de
Seckendorf</i>, and the Baron <i>de Zochau</i>, are Privy Counsellors; and the
Baron <i>de Kinsberg</i> is Marshal of the Court. As to the Troops the
Margravine Regent only keeps
up<!--221.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
such a number as is necessary to furnish
her Quota to the Empire, and to guard her Person.</p>

<p>The Margraviate of <i>Anspach</i> is very much interspersed with Woods, which
makes it a fine Country for Hunting. 'Tis said that it brings in 500000
Crowns every Year to its Sovereign. The Principal Towns are <i>Anspach</i> and
<i>Schwabach</i>, in which Manufactures are erected that do great Prejudice to
the City of <i>Nuremberg</i>.</p>

<p>I think I ought not to omit acquainting you with two things which are
fondly believ'd by the common People, and which the Landlord of the House
where I quarter'd affirm'd to me to be Facts. The one is, that there are
no Rats in all the Country of <i>Anspach</i>, since one of the Family of the
Rat-killing St. <i>Hubert</i> pass'd that way. The other is of the same Tenor,
and admitted for a certain Truth by every Subject in the Dominions of the
House of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, <i>viz.</i> When any one of this Family dies, whether
Prince or Princess, a Woman in White always appears just before in the
Palace. I know not whether you ever heard any thing concerning this
Prophetess of Ill Luck. Be that as it will, the Story which is told of her
is this:</p>

<p><i>Joachim</i> II. Elector of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, having a mind to enlarge his
Palace at <i>Berlin</i>, wanted to buy in several Houses; but an old Woman, the
Owner of one of those Houses, resolv'd not to sell it to him upon any
Terms. The Elector finding her so obstinate sent her the Purchase-Money
and turn'd her out of it; upon which the old Woman swore in a Rage that
she wou'd be an eternal Plague to <i>Joachim</i> and his Posterity. They
pretend that the good Lady keeps her Word, and that she haunts all the
Palaces of the <i>Brandenbourg</i> Family. Yet I never heard any body at
<i>Berlin</i> say they had ever seen her there, tho' that is the Place where
she ought naturally to have taken up her head
Quarters.<!--222.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
My Landlord added
to these fine Stories that the Margravine would not die yet a while,
because the Woman in White had not yet appear'd to any body at Court.</p>

<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Carlsbad, October 10, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>When I took leave of the Court of <i>Anspach</i>, I was honour'd with a
precious mark of the Margravine's Goodness, <i>viz.</i> a weighty Gold Medal;
and now I am again upon my Journey. I was not many hours in travelling
from <i>Anspach</i> to <i>Nuremberg</i>, thro' a Country extremely sandy, but very
well cultivated, and interspers'd with considerable Villages which in our
Country wou'd be reckon'd Towns.</p>

<p>So much has already been said by others of the City of <span class="smcap">Nuremberg</span>, that I
have very little to add to it. I assure you this Town is the most
disagreeable Place in <i>Europe</i> to live in. The Patricians are the People
of the first Rank there, and lord it like the petty Nobles of <i>Venice</i>.
The Government here too has very great Resemblance with the <i>Venetian</i>,
and they have a sort of Doge. In short they are very much like the Frog in
the Fable that strove to swell it self to the Size of the Ox. Of these
Patricians some are very rich, but they are so rude that no body visits
them, and they scarce visit one another. Perhaps you will ask me what I
mean by the Term <i>Patricians</i>? 'Tis this; they are
Gentlemen:<!--223.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
There are
Patrician Families old enough to dispute Antiquity with any of the
Nobility whatsoever, and who were formerly admitted into all the Chapters.
But now the case is otherwise; for the Nobility not only exclude them out
of the Chapters, but dispute their being Gentlemen; pretending that they
derogate from the Title by their Magistratical Offices. Such is, you know,
our <i>Germanic</i> Vanity; the things which are honourable in other Countries,
are with us diminutive: The Court, the Sword, and the Church, are the only
Professions that a Gentleman can follow: If he has not the Talents proper
for one or other of these, or if Fortune frown upon him, he had better be
out of the World than take any Offices of the Magistracy upon him, or
enter into Trade: He had better beg Alms nobly than marry beneath himself.
But I shall not here set up for a Censor of the <i>Germanic</i> Customs. Let us
talk of <i>Nuremberg</i>. This City has 6 Gates, 12 Conduits, and 118 Wells. Of
the Churches St. <i>Laurence</i>'s is the biggest: There's a great many
Reliques in it, particularly a part of the Manger in which our Saviour was
laid, a piece of his Garment, and three Links of the Chains which bound
St. <i>Peter</i>, St. <i>Paul</i>, and St. <i>John</i>. As the <i>Lutherans</i> make no great
account of those Reliques, they wou'd do well to give them to some poor
Catholic Convent, which would thereby soon be enrich'd.</p>

<p>You know that the Government here is altogether Evangelical, <i>i. e.</i>
<i>Lutheran</i>. The Catholics have a small Church in the House of the Teutonic
Order: The <i>Calvinists</i> go to the Church in the Territory of <i>Anspach</i>;
but the <i>Jews</i> are not tolerated because 'tis said they formerly poisoned
the Wells. They live in a Place not far from <i>Nuremberg</i>, but come to Town
every Morning, paying something for their Entrance, have an old Woman set
over<!--224.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
them, who is commonly both their Guard and their Guide, and are
permitted to trade and trick wherever they can till Night, when they are
obliged to retire.</p>

<p>In the Church of the Hospital is kept <i>Charlemain</i>'s Crown, said to weigh
fourteen Pounds, the Sceptre and the Globe, in short all the Ornaments of
Empire except <i>Charlemain</i>'s Sword said to have been brought from Heaven
by an Angel, the same very likely that carry'd the holy Vial and the
Oriflamb to <i>France</i>. That Sword is kept at <i>Aix la Chapelle</i>.</p>

<p>The Trade of <i>Nuremberg</i> is very much fallen off; for besides that the
Toys and Knick-knacks which were formerly made in this City are much out
of fashion, especially in <i>Germany</i>, the Manufactures which the Margraves
of <i>Bareith</i> and <i>Anspach</i> have settled in their Dominions do considerable
Prejudice to <i>Nuremberg</i>.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants of this City may be, (at least I think 'em so) the
honestest People in the World, but they are the most horrible
Complimenters that I know. I cou'd not set my Foot in a Shop, but the
Master, the Mistress, the Children and the Apprentices waited on me into
the very Street, than king me for the Honour I had done them. My Landlord
too, who saw me go in and out twenty times a day, receiv'd me always with
great Ceremony, and ask'd me how I did. And when I went out he pray'd me
not to leave his House long in Contempt, without honouring it with my
Presence.</p>

<p><i>Nuremberg</i> is the richest and most potent Imperial City next to
<i>Hambourg</i>. The Domain of <i>Nuremberg</i> is even much larger than that of
<i>Hambourg</i>, but the latter bears the Bell for Wealth. 'Tis said that
<i>Nuremberg</i> has seven other Towns in its Territory, with 480 Villages and
Parishes. Yet
for<!--225.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
all this 'tis not a rich City; for the Patricians
pocket all the Money, and the Citizens are poor.</p>

<p>Next Day after my Arrival at <i>Nuremberg</i> I set out for
<i>Christian</i>-<span class="smcap">Erlangen</span>, a Town in the Margraviate of <i>Brandenbourg-Bareith</i>,
which owes its flourishing State to a Colony of <i>French</i> People who fled
out of <i>France</i> on account of their Religion.</p>

<p>Forty Years ago <i>Erlangen</i> was but a little Village in the middle of a
Forest of Fir-Trees. The Margrave <i>Christian</i> giving shelter to the
<i>French</i> who left their Country after the Revocation of the Edict of
<i>Nantz</i>, assign'd them <i>Erlangen</i> to settle in. When they cut down the
Woods they built the Town, to which they gave the Name of
<i>Christian-Erlangen</i>, in Memory of <i>Christian</i> their Benefactor. All the
Streets are in a strait Line. The <i>French</i> have set up all sorts of
Manufactures here, and have made it one of the prettiest Towns of
<i>Germany</i>. Madame<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> <i>Elizabeth-Sophia</i> of <i>Brandenbourg</i>, second
Daughter of the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>, and third Wife of the Margrave
<i>Christian</i> Founder of <i>Erlangen</i>, caus'd a very handsome Palace to be
built in the great Square of this City, to which there are noble Gardens.
'Tis at present occupy'd by <i>Sophia</i> of <i>Saxe-Weissenfels</i>, Widow of the
last Margrave of <i>Bareith</i>. This Princess was to have dwelt at <i>Neustadt</i>,
which was settled on her for her Dowry; but as 'tis a lonesome,
melancholy, scoundrel Place, the Margrave Regent was willing she should
live at <i>Erlangen</i>. The Margravine Dowager was one of the most beautiful
Princesses in the World, of which she still preserves the fair Remains,
and none can have an Air more grand. She
lives<!--226.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
at <i>Erlangen</i> with all the
Dignity becoming her Rank. Foreigners are very well received at her Court,
and particularly by the Princess herself, who for Politeness has few
Equals.</p>

<p>From <i>Christian-Erlangen</i> I went in less than a Day to <i>Bamberg</i>, tho' I
stay'd two or three Hours at <span class="smcap">Forcheim</span> a Place in the Bishoprick of
<i>Bamberg</i>, whose Buildings appear'd to me to be old and out of repair.</p>

<p>The Bishoprick of <span class="smcap">Bamberg</span> is the first Bishoprick of the Empire. The
Bishop is Suffragan to no Archbishop. He depends only as to Spirituals
upon the Holy See, and receives the Pall as an Archbishop. He has moreover
this Distinction, that the Electors are his great Officers as they are
those of the Empire, and he has the Privilege of summoning them to come
and do the Duties of their Offices on the Day of his Installation. I have
not heard that any Bishop ever made use of this mighty Prerogative, for
the Retinue which those great Officers would bring along with them might
be a Charge to him. The great Privileges which this Prelate enjoys are
counter-balanc'd by one Mortification; for if the Electors happen to chuse
an Emperor who has no Dominions, the Bishop of <i>Bamberg</i> would be oblig'd
to yield him his Episcopal City and Palace. 'Tis said that the Emperor has
the same Right to <i>Rome</i>, and that if he should chuse that ancient City of
the World for his Residence, the Pope wou'd be oblig'd to yield him the
Palace of the Vatican and to retire to that of St. <i>John de Lateran</i>. But
I really think that the Holy Father and the Bishop of <i>Bamberg</i> will not
be so soon turn'd out.</p>

<p>The late Elector of <i>Mentz</i>, <i>Lotharius-Francis de Schonborn</i>, who was
also Bishop of <i>Bamberg</i>, embellish'd the City with a new Episcopal
Palace, a great and stately Building that stands on an
Eminence,<!--227.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
from
whence there is an extensive Prospect of various Beauties.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Bamberg</i> is very well built, and has beautiful Churches.
Herein is to be seen the Tomb of the Emperor <i>Henry</i> II. and his Wife the
Empress <i>Cunegonda</i>. This Princess lies at the right hand of her Husband,
because she kept her Virginity to her Death. Was not this abusing the
Sacrament of Marriage?</p>

<p>The Bishop who fills the Episcopal See of <i>Bamberg</i> is <i>Frederic-Charles</i>,
Count de <i>Schonborn</i>, Vice-Chancellor of the Empire. This Prelate being
Minister of State to the Emperor commonly resides at <i>Vienna</i>, and is now
there, so that I have nothing to say to you of his Court; but I reckon I
shall be able to give you some Account of him after I have paid my
Respects to him at <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<p>The Neighbourhood of <i>Bamberg</i> is very agreeable, but as one comes to it
from <i>Nuremberg</i> thro' a certain Forest of Fir-Trees, it strikes a Man
with Horror to find an Avenue to it a quarter of a League in length form'd
by Wheels and Gibbets. This, at first sight gives a Stranger no very great
Idea of the Honesty of the People; but he is of another Opinion when he
comes to know that these expos'd Malefactors are for the most part
Foreigners. The Bishoprick of <i>Bamberg</i> is contiguous to seven or eight
different States, and the Town it self lies in the greatest Road of all
<i>Germany</i>, which is the Reason that 'tis so infested by Rogues from all
Quarters. In the time of the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>, <i>Bamberg</i> was their <i>Ne
plus ultra</i>, for that Prince gave them no Quarter: Being an Enemy to
Wickedness, and one of the greatest Justiciaries that we have had in
<i>Germany</i>, he sent all to the Gallows that deserv'd Hanging.</p>

<p>About a League out of the Town the Bishop has a charming Pleasure-House;
but there is nothing
in<!--228.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
all <i>Germany</i> more magnificent than the Castle of
<span class="smcap">Pommersfelden</span> belonging to the Count <i>de Schonborn</i>, which is three
Leagues from <i>Bamberg</i>. <i>Francis Lotharius de Schonborn</i> Elector of
<i>Mentz</i> caus'd this stately Fabric to be built, the whole of which forms a
great Body of Building flank'd by two Pavilions with two advanc'd Wings.
The whole is regularly built, and decorated with well-fancy'd
Architecture. The Entry is supported by several Colonnades, where the
first thing that presents it self is the grand Stair-Case, which is
extraordinary magnificent, and perhaps one of the best contrived in
<i>Europe</i>. This Entry leads into a Salon which serves as a Passage to the
Garden; 'tis in form of a Grotto adorn'd with several Fountains, Columns,
and Statues of Marble: The Cieling is painted as well as the Sky-Light of
the Stair-Case, and the Arches of the principal Apartments. They are all
painted by Hands that the Elector sent for on purpose from <i>Italy</i>. I
don't give you the Particulars of the great Salon, nor of the Apartments,
because it would take up a Volume. The whole are laid out with Art, and
furnish'd with great Choice, Judgment and Splendor.</p>

<p>The Stables answer exactly to the Castle which they front. They are built
in form of a Half-Moon with a Pavilion in the middle, which is an oval
Salon, from both Sides of which you see all the Horses. The Mangers are of
Marble in form of Shells, and the Racks of Iron neatly wrought in form of
a Basket or Scuttle.</p>

<p>The Salon in the middle of the two Stables is painted in Fresco, and looks
one way to the Court, and the other to the Riding-House, where the Elector
us'd to see the Horses manag'd belonging to the Studs of his Bishoprick
near <i>Bamberg</i>, one of the best in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>The Gardens of <i>Pommersfelden</i> are very answerable to the Magnificence of
the Buildings: In
a<!--229.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
word, every Thing belonging to this fine House is
worthy of it. The Builder of it had sublime Ideas: He spared no Cost to
leave Monuments of his Grandeur and Wealth to Posterity, and has made a
House of <i>Pommersfelden</i> which really surpasses some Royal Palaces. But
'tis time to take you out of this fine Place and to carry you back to
<i>Bamberg</i>.</p>

<p>There is a good Number of the Nobility settled in this Town. The Chapter
consists of Persons of Quality: It has the Right of chusing the Bishop;
and 'tis he who governs in the Absence of the Prince. Such a Resort as
here is of the Nobility makes the Time pass away agreeably; but they drink
as hard here as at <i>Fulde</i> and <i>Wurtzbourg</i>, so that it looks as if
Drinking was an inseparable Function of the Ecclesiastical Courts. Having
some Relations in this Town I stay'd there three Days, during which I had
the Pleasure of Drinking every Day with one of my Cousins out of a great
Goblet of solid Gold which weigh'd to the Value of a thousand Ducats. You
can't imagine how well the Wine went down out of a Cup of that Value. I
heartily wish'd that my Cousin wou'd have dealt by me as <i>Joseph</i> did by
<i>Benjamin</i>, and that he had put up his Cup in my Portmanteau, provided he
wou'd not have sent to fetch me back again, as the Governour of <i>Egypt</i>
did his Brother; but this was what my dear Cousin did not think fit to do.
He made me drink my Skin-full of Wine, and only wish'd me my Pockets full
of Gold.</p>

<p>From <i>Bamberg</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Bareith</span> the Residence of the Margrave of
<i>Brandenbourg</i>. The elder of the two Branches of that Family settled in
<i>Franconia</i>. <i>John George</i> Elector of <i>Brandenbourg</i> divided his Dominions
between his three Sons: He left the Electorate with its Appendages to his
eldest Son, and gave the Margraviate of <i>Culmbach</i> to <i>Christian</i> his
second Son, and that of <i>Anspach</i> to his third
Son.<!--230.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
<i>Christian</i> form'd
two Branches, that of <i>Bareith</i> and that of <i>Culmbach</i>. The Branch of
<i>Bareith</i> became extinct in 1726, by the Death of <i>George-William</i>, whose
Widow lives at <i>Erlangen</i>. <i>George-Frederic-Charles</i> Margrave of
<i>Culmbach</i> his Cousin, succeeded him. This Prince has five Children,
<i>viz.</i> two Princes<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and three Princesses<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. He marry'd <i>Dorothy</i> of
<i>Holstein-Beck</i> at <i>Berlin</i> in 1709. I had then the Honour to see him: He
was a Prince of a noble Aspect, very civil, good-natur'd, and temperate,
and a Lover of Books and Men of Learning. He did an Act of Generosity that
perhaps is not to be parallel'd, and which I relate to you as the most
authentic Testimony that can be of his Good-nature and Integrity.</p>

<p>His Predecessor had left an empty Exchequer and a great many Debts; and
the Margrave at his Accession to the Regency was oblig'd to pay the King
of <i>Prussia</i> 460000 Florins, upon condition that his Majesty wou'd
renounce any Pretensions he might have to the Margraviate, by virtue of
the Resignation of all Rights to the Succession which had been made by the
Margrave of <i>Culmbach</i> his Father, in favour of <i>Frederic</i> I. King of
<i>Prussia</i>. To raise this Sum on People already overburden'd by the common
Taxes, was to seek their Ruin. The Margrave in pity of their miserable
Condition, chose rather to borrow this Money of the States of the Circle
of <i>Franconia</i> at great Interest. When he found himself in peaceable
possession of his Dominions by the Payment made to the King of <i>Prussia</i>,
he undertook to pay off not only his own, but the Debts of his
Predecessor. To enable himself to
do<!--231.png--><span class="pagenum">206</span>
this, he began by turning off his
Court, kept but a small Number of Counsellors and Gentlemen, and disbanded
3000 Men of the Troops which the late Margrave kept in pay to no purpose.
He reduc'd his Table to the greatest Frugality; his Clothes were plain,
and he avoided Magnificence and Gaming. Some time after this, he made
another Reform in his House, and kept up but a very small Number of
Domestics. He establish'd a Council of Regency, and to save the Expence
which his Rank as a Sovereign would have engag'd him in whether he wou'd
or not, he left his Dominions, and went to live incognito with the
Hereditary Prince his Son at <i>Geneva</i>. I believe that both of them are
actually at <i>Montpellier</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. He is resolv'd not to return to his
Dominions till all his Debts are paid off. Mean time his Subjects wish for
his Return with Impatience, for he has such a Kindness for them, and
governs them with such mildness that they look on him as their Father and
Benefactor. This Retirement of the Margrave from the Splendors of
Sovereignty is the more to be commended because 'tis absolutely voluntary:
He was not at all oblig'd to pay the Debts of his Predecessor; for they
were of such a Nature as not to be rank'd among the Debts of the
Government. Nevertheless it was his Pleasure to do it, and he chose rather
to abridge himself of the Charms of Sovereignty than that People, whose
Faith in the Government had made them part with their Money, shou'd lose
their Debts. Such a glorious Action as this, is in my Judgment equal to
the Laurels of twenty Victories: This was owing to his Virtue, whereas
Victory is generally the Consequent of Chance and Fortune.</p>

<p>You will easily imagine that while the Sovereign is absent this City is
not very gay. It
appear'd<!--232.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to me the more melancholy because I had seen it
in the time of the late Margrave, at whose Court there was continual
Feasting and Jollitry.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Bareith</i> is inferior to <i>Erlangen</i>. The Margrave's Palace is
a great old Pile, but not very commodious, and meanly furnish'd. This
Prince has a very pretty House, a League from <i>Bareith</i>, call'd the
<i>Hermitage</i>, which was built by Order of the late Margrave.</p>

<p>It stands in the middle of a thick Wood, in which there are a great many
Pavilions built, without any Symmetry indeed, but very ingeniously
contriv'd within for the Use to which they serve. When the late Margrave
came to the Hermitage, he and his whole Court were in the Dress of
Hermits. There were certain Hours in which the Hermit Brothers went to pay
a Visit to the Hermit Sisters, who liv'd in the Pavilions. The Brothers
and Sisters who gave each other Collations, were subject to certain Rules
from which they could not be dispensed but by the Remission of the
Superior of either Sex, who were then the Margrave, and his Lady the
Margravine. In the Evening they met again in the Hall of the Castle, where
they supp'd; and that every thing might be done according to the Rules, at
the beginning of the Supper certain Verses were read, or some little Story
compos'd by one or other of the Hermit Brothers; then Silence was broke,
and every one gave his Opinion upon what had been read, upon which there
ensued a general Conversation. The Supper held till pretty late, and was
commonly followed with a Ball. No body could be admitted into the Order
without the general Consent of the Chapter. And the Superior himself had
no Right but to propose such as were Candidates for Admission. To give you
all the Statutes of this Society, would be too tedious; besides I should
be afraid of adding or
diminishing<!--233.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
to them, because I only have them from
Tradition.</p>

<p>The Margrave has a Mother still alive, <i>viz.</i> <i>Sophia-Christina</i> Countess
of <i>Wolffenstein</i>, who lives at <i>Copenhagen</i> with her Daughter the
Princess Royal<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> of <i>Denmark</i>. The King of <i>Denmark</i> grants her the
Title of Royal Highness, and causes the same Honours to be paid to her as
to the Princesses of his Family.</p>

<p>The Margrave has also three Brothers and two Sisters. The eldest of the
Brothers is a Major-General and Colonel of Foot in the Service of the
Emperor, and the two others are in the Service of <i>Denmark</i>. The two
Princesses are marry'd, one to the Prince Royal of <i>Denmark</i>, the other to
<i>George-Albert</i> Prince of <i>East-Friesland</i>. So that the intire Family of
<i>Brandenbourg-Culmbach</i> consists of Princes and Princesses to the number
of twelve.</p>

<p>The Revenues of this Margrave are pretty near the same as those of the
Margrave of <i>Anspach</i>. His Fortress is the Castle of <i>Plassenberg</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Bareith</i> I came in two Days to <span class="smcap">Carlsbad</span>, a Place of Fame for its hot
Waters, of which there are two Sorts differing from one another both in
Strength and Heat. They derive their Source from the middle of a River
form'd by Torrents from the neighbouring Mountains, whose Waters are
extremely cold; yet they make not the least Alteration in the heat of the
Mineral Waters. They are said to be very wholesome for all sorts of
Maladies, particularly for the Gravel, and for the Barrenness of Women. M.
<i>Hofman</i>, a celebrated Professor of Physic at <i>Hall</i>, has published a
Treatise, wherein he examines the nature of those Waters, and prescribes
how they ought to be used. The Manner is very disagreeable; you are
obliged to be shut up in a Room, and be the Weather ever
so<!--234.png--><span class="pagenum">209</span>
hot, the
Stove must be heated, you must be tormented by taking off two or three
Pots of Water, which are almost equal to thirty Chocolate Cups; besides
walking about very much, and sweating great Drops.</p>

<p>To make amends for the Fatigue of the Morning, there is good Company to be
seen here all Day long; for Abundance of Strangers come to <i>Carlsbad</i>,
particularly the Nobility of <i>Bohemia</i> and <i>Austria</i>. There are publick
Walks and a great Room adjacent, where they play, dance and walk till the
Evening. They who love to live by Rule retire without Supper.</p>

<p>Whoever would be well accommodated at <i>Carlsbad</i> must carry three things
thither with him, his own Bed, Wine, and Cook; tho' a Foot-boy may serve
for the Cook, because one is generally invited by the <i>Bohemian</i> or
<i>Austrian</i> Noblemen, who always keep a great Table, and love Company to
dine with 'em.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants of <i>Carlsbad</i> are generally Armourers, who work very neat
and vastly cheap. At the Season for using the Waters, Merchants flock
hither from all Parts, and <i>Carlsbad</i> is superior to many great Towns. I
had a great deal of Amusement during the two different Seasons that I
pass'd there, and I contracted a World of good Acquaintance, who, I hope,
will be of Service to me at <i>Prague</i>, for which Place I propose to set out
to-morrow. I am, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XI.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Prague, November 15, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I have now been a Month in this City, yet it seems but as a Day; for I
find infinite Amusements here, and a thousand things that I like, only I
want your Company. The City of <span class="smcap">Prague</span> is ancient, and has been time out of
mind, the Seat of the Kings of <i>Bohemia</i>. 'Tis without dispute one of the
Biggest Towns in <i>Europe</i>. 'Tis encompass'd with Ramparts, and as well
fortified as a Place of that Extent can be, and commanded by several
Hills, which 'tis impossible to level. This City is divided by the River
<i>Molde</i> or <i>Muldaw</i>, into two Parts, <i>viz.</i> <i>Old Prague</i> and <i>Little
Prague</i>; and during the Course of the last Century, it suffer'd the
greatest Cruelties that a City can possibly undergo in a time of War. The
Archduke <i>Leopold</i> Bishop of <i>Passau</i> surpriz'd and plunder'd the lesser
Part, and would have done the same by the old Town, if the Emperor
<i>Matthias</i> King of <i>Hungary</i> had not come in time to relieve it. Nine
Years after this, <i>Prague</i> was again plunder'd by those who were most
concerned to preserve it; I mean the Imperialists, who, after the Battle
at <i>Weissenberg</i>, near <i>Prague</i>, wherein they defeated <i>Frederic</i> Elector
Palatine whom a Party had chose King of <i>Bohemia</i>, enter'd the City, and
carried off inestimable Booty. <i>Prague</i> was used no better in 1631, by the
Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, after that Prince made himself Master of <i>Bohemia</i>.
The Great <i>Walstein</i> of so much Note
for<!--236.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
his Glorious Actions, and his
Tragical Exit, recover'd <i>Bohemia</i> from the <i>Saxon</i> in 1632, and took
<i>Prague</i> by Storm. Some time after this the <i>Swedes</i> attack'd it, and took
the lesser <i>Prague</i>; but could not force the old Town, it was so
courageously defended by the Students and Burghers. The <i>Swedes</i> thereupon
retired, and carry'd off immense Wealth. At length the Peace of
<i>Westphalia</i> restored Tranquillity to <i>Bohemia</i> and the City of <i>Prague</i>,
which has been subject ever since to the House of <i>Austria</i>; and the
Kingdom which before was Elective, had the Mortification to become
Hereditary.</p>

<p>The Situation of <i>Prague</i> is pleasant in the midst of Gardens and fine
Fields, and 'tis adorn'd with noble Buildings, of which the Houses of the
Counts <i>Tschernin</i> and <i>Sternberg</i> are as fine as any. The Furniture of
the former is extremely rich; there is a Gallery adorned with excellent
Pictures, a Cabinet of choice Porcellane with entire Services of the
finest <i>Indian Lacca</i>; and another Room full of fine Arms and other
Curiosities. Count <i>Sternberg</i>'s House is not so large, yet better
contriv'd; and in <i>Rome</i> it self would pass for a fine Palace. But there
is one built by the late Count <i>de Gallasch</i>, who died Viceroy at
<i>Naples</i>, that bears the Bell above all. You know that Nobleman was
prodigiously rich and magnificent. He spared no Cost in his Buildings.
'Tis pity the House is not well situate, but it certainly would be so, if
the young Count <i>de Gallasch</i> was of the same Way of Thinking with his
Father, who intended to have had five or six old Hovels belonging to it
pull'd down to the ground, by which means he would have had a fine Square.</p>

<p>The Convents of both Sexes are another Ornament of this Great City. The
House of the Reverend Fathers the Jesuits is one of the most magnificent.
They have lately caused a Church to be built, which is one of the best
adorned that I
have<!--237.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
seen out of <i>Italy</i>. If you were but here, we would
go together and see all those Buildings. I would carry you first of all to
the Cathedral, which is in lesser <i>Prague</i>, on the Top of the Hill call'd
<i>Ratschin</i>, and from thence we would go and take a View of the Castle
which is upon the same Hill.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Church is a very antient Structure, which was burnt down
by the <i>Swedes</i>, and is only rebuilt in part. Its Magnificence and Beauty
consist in the thickness of its Walls and Arches; and the Architecture of
this Church is such, that I fancy it would appear <i>Gothic</i> to the very
<i>Goths</i> themselves. 'Tis in this Cathedral that the Kings and Queens of
<i>Bohemia</i> are consecrated. The Archbishop of <i>Prague</i>'s Office is to
perform the Unction upon both; but the Abbess of St. <i>George</i>, whose Abbey
is also upon the Hill of <i>Ratschin</i>, is to place the Crown upon the Head
of the Queen, and in this Function she is assisted by the Wives of the
Great Officers of the Crown.</p>

<p>In this Metropolitan Church are preserved with great Veneration the Bodies
of a couple of Saints extremely dear to the <i>Bohemians</i>. The one is St.
<i>Wenceslaus</i> King of <i>Bohemia</i>, the other St. <i>John Nepomucene</i>. The
latter was very lately canonized by Pope <i>Benedict</i> XIII. at the Request
of the States of this Kingdom, who were at the whole Expence of the
Ceremony, which was performed in the Church of St. <i>John de Lateran</i> at
<i>Rome</i> with extraordinary Pomp.</p>

<p>The Story of this Saint is very singular: He was Confessor to the Wife of
that cruel Emperor <i>Wenceslaus</i>, who was deposed by the Electors. That
Prince being jealous of his Queen enjoined St. <i>John Nepomucene</i> to reveal
that Princess's Confessions to him. He employed Presents, Prayers and
Threats, to persuade the Saint to make this Discovery, but all to no
purpose; upon which he caused him to
be<!--238.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
cast headlong from the Bridge
into the River of <i>Molde</i>. The Body was seen floating at some distance
from the Place, attended with five Stars swimming on the Water; then he
was added to the Number of the Saints and Martyrs, and his Corpse was
taken out of the River, and carried with Pomp to <i>Prague</i>, where it was
interr'd in the Church of <i>Dain</i> in the old Town, of which he was a Canon.
His Corpse being found some Years ago, his Tongue appearing to be as fresh
as ever, was taken out of his Mouth and put into a Silver Gilt Box; the
Body was enclosed in a stately Coffin, and the whole carried with great
Ceremony to the Cathedral. An Altar being erected in the middle of the
right Wing of the Choir, there the Saint was interr'd in a Tomb of Silver
Gilt; and the Tongue put into a sort of Tabernacle where it has wrought
and does still work great Miracles. There is a great Concourse of People
hither from all Parts to invoke this Saint, whose Tomb is loaded with
precious Gifts, and adorned by the Empress with a rich Canopy. But no body
has given more illustrious Proofs of Devotion to St. <i>Nepomucene</i> than the
Prince <i>de Schwartzenberg</i><a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Master of the Horse to the Emperor, and the
Count <i>de Martinitz</i> Marshal of the Imperial Court; who both ascribe the
Conception of their Wives, and the Birth of their Sons, to the Protection
of that Saint, tho' I should have thought all this feasible enough without
a Miracle. The Princess <i>de Schwartzenberg</i> had not been married many
Years before she had a Daughter<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>; her Husband had not seen her for
fourteen Years after this, during which she had no Children. This is no
more than common; after they came together again Madam is brought to Bed
of a Son, in which tho' there is nothing but what is
very<!--239.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
natural, yet
'tis cry'd up for a Miracle; the Birth is ascribed to the Devotion which
the Princes paid to the Tomb of St. <i>Nepomucene</i> for nine Days together,
and to make the Saint some amends, his Tomb and his Altar are adorn'd by a
great many Vessels of Silver and Silver gilt.</p>

<p>As to Count <i>Martinitz</i> there seems indeed to be better colour for a
Miracle in his favour. He had been married fourteen or fifteen Years, and
his Lady never given the least Sign of Teemingness. She was in good plight
of body, her Husband liv'd with her, and they went together several times
to the Baths of <i>Carlsbad</i>, but all had signified nothing. The Count
longing passionately for a Son had perform'd more than nine days Devotion
successively, for he went the last Holy Year to <i>Loretto</i> and to <i>Rome</i>.
But Heaven deaf to his Cries granted him no Heir; at last knowing not what
Saint to pray to, his Lady propos'd, that they should go and worship nine
days together at the Tomb of St. <i>Nepomucene</i>. They set out, they arrive
at <i>Prague</i>, they prostrate themselves before the sacred Tomb. Soon after,
Madame <i>de Martinitz</i> proves with Child, and at nine Months end is
delivered of a Son. You may say whatever you please, but such a Favour
sure was worth some Lamps of solid Silver before the Saint's Tomb; and the
Count <i>de Martinitz</i> full of Zeal and Gratitude has given some that are
very magnificent.</p>

<p>The <i>Bohemians</i> have so great confidence in St. <i>John de Nepomucene</i>, that
they have almost forgot St. <i>Wenceslaus</i> their old Patron. There is no
Church where St. <i>John</i> has not a Chapel, no Bridge without his Effigy;
every body Gentle and Simple, Men and Women, wear his Picture as if it
were the Badge of an Order, hanging to a straw-colour'd Ribbon, and you
would swear that all the <i>Bohemians</i> were Knights of St. <i>Louis</i>. In
short, St. <i>Nepomucene</i>
is<!--240.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the only Saint in vogue; and Presents are
heap'd upon him to such a degree that if it continues much longer, he will
be as rich as our Lady of <i>Loretto</i>.</p>

<p>The Palace or Castle which joins to the Cathedral is a great Building
composed of several Main Bodies without Symmetry or Architecture. The
Apartments are but low and plain, but here is one of the most beautiful
Prospects in the World. The great Hall in which the Royal Feast is kept on
the Day of the Coronation of the Kings is the largest of the kind, next to
the spacious Hall of <i>Westminster</i>. The Palace-Gardens are large, but have
nothing to recommend them besides their Situation. The Tribunals of the
Regency meet in the Palace: The first of these consists of Stadtholders
who are of the Emperor's Privy Council. They are to the Number of twelve,
and represent the Sovereign. Most of them are the great Officers of the
Crown. There must be always two of them private Gentlemen to take care of
the Interests of the Gentry against the Nobility; for you must know that
the Princes, Counts, and Barons, who compose the Nobility, form a separate
Body here, and would think it a Disparagement to be call'd <i>Gentlemen</i>;
tho' <i>Henry</i> IV. King of <i>France</i> counted it an honour to be the first
Gentleman in his Kingdom, and King <i>Francis</i> I. whenever he affirmed a
thing, said, <i>Upon the Word of a Gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>The Chief of the Council of the Stadtholders is call'd the <i>Great
Burgrave</i>, whose Dignity is the highest in the Kingdom. He represents the
Person of the Emperor, and is inferior to none but the Chancery of
<i>Bohemia</i> which always attends the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Bridge over the <i>Muldaw</i> which joins little <i>Prague</i> to the old Town,
is one of the longest and most substantial Bridges in <i>Europe</i>. It has on
both<!--241.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
sides the Statues of several Saints, which if they had been done by
a better hand, would have prov'd an Ornament. There is a Crucifix also
which is pretended to be of Gold, and to have been erected formerly at the
Expence of the <i>Jews</i>, pursuant to an Order of the Government, as a
Punishment for their having crucified a Christian Infant upon
<i>Easter</i>-Day, to insult the Memory of our Saviour's Death.</p>

<p>The <i>Jews</i> are the only Sectaries that are tolerated in <i>Bohemia</i>. There
are some <i>Hussites</i> still subsisting, but they keep so close, that the
Government does not seem to know that there are any at all. I was assur'd
that in <i>Prague</i> alone there were no less than 80,000 <i>Jews</i>; whether
there are quite so many, I know not; but 'tis certain they are very
numerous. Their Quarter in the old City forms a little separate Town. They
have all the Trade in their own hands, follow all sorts of Callings, and
by their receiving all old-fashion'd things in Payment, they quite ruin
the Christian Handicrafts-men. As these People multiply like Rabbets, 'tis
said the Emperor is going to issue an Ordinance prohibiting any but their
eldest Sons to marry; the Report of which is so alarming to the <i>Jews</i>,
that they would advance great Sums to prevent its taking effect.</p>

<p>If we except <i>Rome</i>, <i>Paris</i>, and <i>London</i>, there is no City where there
are more Gentry, or a Gentry that is more wealthy: Every body here lives
grand; and in no Part of the World do the Nobility keep greater State, or
take more Pride in their Substance. They are polite and civil to
Strangers, whom they know to be Persons of Quality. For my own part, I
like them prodigiously, and I can safely say it, I have hardly met with a
Foreigner who has not the same Notion of <i>Prague</i> that I have.</p>

<!--242.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>There is not a Gentleman in this Country but has seen at least <i>Holland</i>,
<i>France</i>, and <i>Italy</i>, and indeed they are under some necessity of
travelling, for the Education they have at home is none of the best. But
they don't travel as People of their Birth and Fortunes ought to do. They
are commonly attended by a sort of Governors, who make it their Profession
to ramble abroad with young Gentlemen, and are for the most part
<i>Walloons</i>, <i>Luxemburghers</i>, <i>Lorrainers</i>, or <i>Liegeois</i>, Soldiers of
Fortune, without Education, and without Manners; who think 'tis enough for
their Pupils to see Houses and Churches, and having not the Courage or the
Capacity to put themselves forward, or even to shew their Heads, don't
care that their Gentlemen should keep Company. They tell <i>young Master</i>,
that my Lord his Father, who put him under their Care, recommended
&OElig;conomy to them; that they might game at Assemblies, but that 'tis not
well to play while they are travelling: Therefore the Spark is oblig'd to
keep in his Quarters, or if he is perhaps permitted to go to the public
Shews, even this Pleasure, because it is not to be had without Money, must
be taken in Moderation; the Governor's Aim is only to crib all he can, and
sink his Pupil's Money into his own Purse. This is so true that I have
known some who never eat Suppers, yet always brought them to Accompt; many
of 'em get a Profit by every thing they buy, and they make such hard
Bargains that 'tis ten to one if they don't chouse the Merchant as well as
their Pupil. If the Governor does not like the Place they come to, he must
be gone, tho' it were the most proper Town in the World to form the young
Gentleman; for the Governor only writes to the Father or Mother that the
Air did not agree with their Son, and that therefore he had remov'd him.
The Generality of these wretched Guides maintain that six Weeks
or<!--243.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
three
Months Stay at most is sufficient to know <i>Paris</i>; a Fortnight to be
thoroughly acquainted with the Genius of the <i>English</i>; a Month to know
<i>Rome</i>; a Week to see <i>Naples</i>; and so of the rest: And when they have
shewn their Gentleman at <i>Paris</i>, the Anatomical Wax-work and the
Observatory; at <i>London</i>, the Lions in the Tower; at <i>Rome</i>, the
Catacombs; and at <i>Naples</i>, the Liquefaction of St. <i>Januarius</i>'s Blood,
and Mount <i>Vesuvius</i>; they think they have done great matters, and away
they go without having made an Acquaintance with one Soul at any of the
Courts. They have seen the King of <i>France</i> touch for the Evil; The King
of <i>England</i> go to the Parliament-House; and the Pope sitting in his
Elbow-Chair, distributing his Benedictions. With a Mind thus adorn'd, the
young Man, after eighteen Months or two Years Absence abroad, returns
home. The Governor has two or three thousand Florins, and sometimes more
as a Gratuity, besides his Stipend. Again, the worthy <i>Mentor</i> makes a
Bubble of the Father who trusts his Son with him, and behold now, he is
ready for another Tour. One would think that, instead of travelling in
this manner, it were better to send abroad for the Plans of all the Towns,
I am sure 'twould be cheaper; the Parents would have the comfort to see
their Sons at home, and they would also have wherewithal to furnish a
little Box in the Country.</p>

<p>There are no People of Quality in the World more addicted to an expensive
way of Living than those of <i>Prague</i>, which is the Reason that for all
their immense Revenues they are sometimes over Head and Ears in Debt; but
by good Luck they have a Settlement which prevents them from total Ruin:
For most of their Lands are intail'd for ever on the eldest Son of the
Family, so that he can neither alienate nor incumber them without the
Consent<!--244.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of the whole Family, and of the King himself, which is a Thing
very hard to be obtain'd. When an eldest Son of a Family has squander'd
his Freehold, and runs himself more and more in debt, the Creditors, and
sometimes the Parents themselves, present a Petition to the King and
desire a Sequestration. The King after being inform'd of the List of the
Debts, and of the <i>Majorat</i> (which is the Name they give here to the Lands
that are intail'd) names Trustees for the Administration of the Estates of
the Spendthrift, who is allow'd a Pension till all the Debts are paid.
There's another very good Establishment here for securing the Sale of
Landed Estates and Mortgages. Every Nobleman gives in a Particular of his
Estate to a Tribunal which is call'd the <i>Landtaffel</i>, where the same is
register'd. When a Person wants to borrow Money or to make a Sale, the
Lender or the Purchaser has recourse to the <i>Landtaffel</i>'s Office, where
he sees whether the Lands are incumber'd; and if the Borrower's Debts
don't exceed two Thirds of the Price at which they are rated by the
<i>Landtaffel</i>, he may lend his Money very safely.</p>

<p>Tho' the <i>Bohemians</i> are brave and good Soldiers, yet they don't love the
Service, I mean the Gentry: Most of them prefer the Civil to Military
Employments, and a private Life to Posts in the Army or at Court. They are
so us'd to be absolute Masters at their Estates where the Peasants are
their Slaves, and to be homag'd like Petty Sovereigns by the Burghers at
<i>Prague</i>, that they don't care to reside at <i>Vienna</i>, and to be oblig'd
like other Subjects to pay their Court to the Sovereign and the Ministers.
As soon as a Gentleman of <i>Bohemia</i> comes of Age, he is oblig'd to take an
Oath of Fidelity to the Emperor as his King; which is a Law as much
binding on the Nobility as the Gentry; and none of 'em dare to go out of
the Kingdom without
express<!--245.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Leave from the Emperor, on the Penalty of
forfeiting his Estate. When the Noblemen are return'd from their Travels
to <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i>, they put in to be Chamberlains, not so much for
the sake of engaging themselves to Attendance at Court as to procure a
Precedency for their Wives, it being a Custom with most of 'em to marry as
soon as they come of Age. Afterwards they aim to be Counsellors of State,
and Stadtholders, and this is the <i>Ne plus ultra</i> of their Preferments.
The Counsellors of State challenge the Title of <i>Excellency</i>: But this is
what those who are not of that Denomination, and of as good Families as
themselves, scruple to allow them, so that generally speaking they have it
only given them by their Domestics and Dependants. So that one may say of
their Excellencies what the Duchess of <i>Elb&oelig;uf</i> of the <i>Lorrain</i> Family
said in <i>France</i> concerning the Princes of <i>Bouillon</i>, that they were
<i>Domestic Highnesses</i>, because none but their own Servants give them the
Title of <i>Highness</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the great and wealthy Families, those of <i>Lobkowitz</i>, <i>Kinski</i>,
<i>Schlick</i>, <i>Collobradt</i>, and <i>Martinitz</i> are the only ones that make a
Figure at the Imperial Court. 'Tis true there are several other Noblemen
at <i>Vienna</i> who have Lands in <i>Bohemia</i>, but then their Families are not
originally descended from that Kingdom.</p>

<p>The <i>Kinski</i>'s Family is actually the most splendid at Court. There are
five Brothers of it in Employments. The eldest is the Great Chancellor of
<i>Bohemia</i><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. The second who is call'd Count <i>Stephen</i>, is Great Marshal
of <i>Bohemia</i>, a Minister of State, and the Emperor's Ambassador at the
Court of <i>France</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. The third, Count <i>Philip</i>, is the Emperor's
<!--246.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>Minister
Plenipotentiary to <i>Great Britain</i>; and the two youngest are in
the Army, where one of them is a Lieutenant-Colonel. Count <i>Philip</i> was
sent Ambassador when but twenty nine Years old. He has demonstrated by his
Conduct that Wisdom does not always stay for Age, and that he is the
worthy Son of one of the greatest Ministers that<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the Emperors
<i>Leopold</i> and <i>Joseph</i> ever had. The City of <i>Prague</i> is a very great
Loser by his Absence, for he liv'd there with Splendor, and his House was
always open, particularly to Foreigners. For my own part I receiv'd such
Civilities there as I shall never forget.</p>

<p>As I have told you that the Nobility of <i>Bohemia</i> are the richest in the
Empire, I must also acquaint you that the Peasants there are miserable to
the last degree; their Persons, and all they have, are at the Command of
their Lord. The poor Wretches have often not a Bit of Bread to eat, in a
Country which is one of the most plentiful in <i>Europe</i> for all sorts of
Provisions. They dare not go from one Village to another to work, nor
learn a Handicraft without their Lord's Consent. So much Subjection keeps
the poor Creatures always trembling and humble, so that if you do but
speak to 'em they are ready to lick the Dust off your Feet. The Severity
with which these People are us'd is really terrible, but 'tis as true on
the other hand, that gentle Usage has no Effect upon 'em; for they are
excessively lazy and stubborn, and being moreover us'd to harsh Treatment
from Generation to Generation, Blows scarce terrify them, tho' tis the
only way to make 'em good for any thing.</p>

<!--247.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Bohemians</i> have a great many Talents for Music, so that there's no
Village, be it ever so small, but the Mass is sung in Concert, and they
are very happy at winding the Hunters Horn.</p>

<p>'Tis certain that this Kingdom is one of the best Countries in the
Emperor's possession, and next to <i>Hungary</i>, brings him in most Money.</p>

<p><i>Bohemia</i> is a Country of States, whom the Emperor as King of it, summons
every Year to the City of <i>Prague</i>. They consist of the Clergy, Nobility,
Gentry, and Towns. The Assembly is open'd by a Commissioner of the
Emperor's Nomination, who lays before them his Imperial Majesty's Demands.
The States, such is their Submission and Zeal, grant the full Demand which
is commonly a very great Sum; yet for all this, the <i>Bohemians</i> wou'd not
complain of Taxes if the Emperor resided among them, but they are sorry to
see their Country exhausted to enrich the <i>Austrians</i> to whom they have a
natural Aversion, and the <i>Austrians</i> as heartily hate the <i>Bohemians</i>.</p>

<p>I own to you I shall be sorry to leave <i>Prague</i>. I take the <i>Bohemians</i> to
be the best People upon Earth, and <i>Prague</i> to be one of those Towns of
the Empire where a Gentleman may have most choice of Company. The Ladies
here are very amiable. Gaming, which may be call'd the universal Pleasure,
is carry'd as high here as they please in Houses of the Quality, where
Assemblies of both Sexes are held every Night, with good Cheer,
particularly Pheasants and Ortolans in plenty; and upon Fish-Days, there
are Trouts, Salmon, and Cray-Fish; and that there may be nothing wanting,
<i>Bohemia</i> likewise furnishes good Wine. At the Estate of the young Count
<i>Tschernin</i> at <i>Melneg</i>, there is a red sort not inferior to <i>Burgundy</i>.
Of all these good Things many partake together, and for my part I own I am
taken more with
this<!--248.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Pleasure than any other, because we make it last as
long as we will, and then 'tis suited to all Ages.</p>

<p>There is a tolerable <i>Italian Opera</i> here. In Winter they have Races in
stately Sledges: There is great Masquerading, and they dance till they are
ready to drop to the ground: For this end there are public Balls which are
extraordinary splendid, and might be compar'd, if any can be compar'd,
with the Balls at the <i>Hay-Market</i> in <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>In the Summer-Time when there is not so much Company in Town, these
Assemblies are thinner. The Gentry meet at Night in a Garden belonging to
the Prince <i>de Schwartzenberg</i>, where they game, chat, and walk up and
down, after which they always go to some House or other to sup. When one
has a mind to go to the Country, we are sure of a good Reception, and the
longer one stays the greater Pleasure one gives to the Master of the
House. Here they pass the Time in Hunting of all sorts. Many of the
Nobility keep Packs of Hounds, and others Hawks. The Generality keep
Musicians in their Service, so that let the Weather be what it will, one
may be always amused in this Country. Besides, one enjoys all the Freedom
here that can be. After this, Sir, can you blame me for being sorry to
leave <i>Bohemia</i>? But 'tis what I'm now preparing to do, and I purpose to
go to <i>Vienna</i>. You will be so good as to let me have a Line from you
there; for to be plain with you, to write three Letters for one is too
hard. 'Tis true that your's are of inestimable Value, and that therefore
you are in the right not to be lavish of them; but the same Reason
justifies me in desiring them. Adieu, Sir: Love me always a little, and be
assur'd that no Man is more than I, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Vienna, Nov. 30, 1729.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>The Court of <span class="smcap">Vienna</span> consists of so many Princes and Noblemen, that it
cannot be deny'd to be the greatest and most magnificent Court in
<i>Europe</i>. Nevertheless Ceremonies, and the <i>Etiquette</i>, a Name by which
they call ancient Usages, give it an Air of Constraint that is to be seen
no where else. There's a universal Out-cry against the latter, and even
the Emperor sometimes seems to be disturb'd at it, yet 'tis observ'd as
strictly as if it was an Article of Religion, and nothing cou'd set it
aside but an Oecumenical Council.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, a Foreigner of Quality (for such he must be here)
finds Advantages at this Court which he does not meet with either at
<i>Paris</i> or <i>London</i>, I mean Opportunities of making Acquaintance. After a
Person has been to wait on their Imperial Majesties he need only be
introduc'd into one single Family to be soon made known to all the rest,
with this Advantage too, that go where you will, they speak the <i>German</i>,
<i>French</i>, <i>Italian</i>, and <i>Spanish</i> Languages; whereas a Foreigner at
<i>Paris</i> is under a Necessity of speaking <i>French</i>, and at <i>London</i>
<i>English</i>; but a Man may shift very well at <i>Vienna</i> without the
<i>High-Dutch</i> or <i>German</i> Language.</p>

<p>The Ministers and great Lords of the Court are Civil, Courteous, and of
easy Access, especially to such as want no Favour of 'em, and come to
<i>Vienna</i><!--250.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
only for Curiosity or Business. The Way of these Gentlemen is to
return no Visits: but they invite People to their Tables, which being
always well fill'd, a Man soon gets a great deal of Acquaintance.</p>

<p>'Tis a very easy matter to be admitted to kiss the Hands of their Imperial
Majesties, and even to obtain a private Audience of 'em; for there needs
nothing more than to give in your Name to the Emperor's Great Chamberlain
and the Empress's Great Master of the Houshold. When you kiss their Hands
you bend one Knee to the Ground, and the Time for it is generally when
their Majesties pass by to Dinner. But private Audiences are attended with
more Ceremonies. The Great Chamberlain having appointed the Hour of
meeting in his Antichamber, which is commonly five o'clock in the Evening,
he repairs thither at that Time, and introduces to the Audience; and if he
be absent, 'tis done by the Chamberlain in Waiting. The Ceremony observ'd
is this: The Emperor stands up under a Canopy, leaning with his Back
against a Table, and an Arm-Chair by his Side, A Screen of red Velvet with
Gold Fringe is plac'd at the Entrance of the Room, so that the Emperor is
not perceiv'd at the opening of the Door. Behind this Screen near the
Door, stands the Great Chamberlain. As soon as the Person comes in sight
of the Emperor he bends the Knee, which he repeats as he advances a little
farther, and again when he comes near to his Imperial Majesty. To these
Genuflexions the Emperor gives a Nod of the Head, hearkens very
attentively to the Person who addresses him, and returns a succinct and
gracious Answer. Then the Person kneeling with one Knee on the Ground
kisses his Majesty's Hand, after which he retires, going backwards and
making three Genuflexions as he did at Entrance. The same Ceremonies are
observ'd at an Audience of
the<!--251.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Empress, who gives it standing just as the
Emperor does, with this Difference only that the Emperor is all alone, and
the Empress is attended with one of her Ladies of Honour, who nevertheless
stands off at such a Distance that she can't hear what is said.</p>

<p>The Emperor commonly eats with the Empress and the Arch-Duchesses. But
there are particular Days, such as the Installation of the Knights of the
<i>Golden Fleece</i>, when the Empress herself is not allow'd to sit down at
Table with his Imperial Majesty. The Dinner is commonly in the Emperor's
Apartment, and the Supper at the Empress's. At Dinner two Chamberlains
hold the Ewer for their Majesties to wash, and the Steward, or in his
absence the Great Chamberlain presents them the Napkin, which is done
after the manner of <i>Spain</i>, with one Knee on the Ground. The Number of
Dishes at the Emperor's Table is forty eight, and the same at the
Empress's; but tho' their Majesties eat together they are each serv'd by
their own Officers and Cooks. They commonly drink both together at the
first Time; and till they have drank, the Ambassadors, Courtiers, and
Ladies all wait at Dinner. After the Emperor has drank, the Steward, the
Master of the Horse, the Great Chamberlain, and the Captain of the Guards
receive his Orders: The Lady of Honour in Waiting and the Empress's
Steward receive her Orders in like manner. None remain in the Room but the
Officers necessary for the Service, and some curious People who are not
us'd to see Sovereigns eat. On Sundays, Saints Days, and Days of <i>Gala</i>,
which is the Name they give here to Days of Festival and Ceremony, the
Dinner is attended with Music. I forgot to acquaint you that the Emperor
is always cover'd at Table, and that when he puts his Hat on the
Ambassadors put on theirs.</p>

<!--252.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>At Supper the Lady of Honour who is in waiting presents the Napkin, and
the Ladies of the Bed-Chamber not only carve and hand the Victuals, but
taste both the Meat and the Wine. The Pages carry the Dishes and Plates,
and fetch the Wine from the Beaufet which they give to the Ladies, and
they to their Majesties. During the Supper as well as at Dinner all the
Gentlemen and Ladies stand up, so that here neither Princes nor Princesses
have any Distinction shew'd them, but all Ranks are levell'd and
confounded, and no body sits down in presence of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>On the Days of <i>Gala</i> the Court is extremely gay, and nothing is to be
seen but Gold and Diamonds. The Days of this kind that are celebrated with
most Splendor are those of St. <i>Charles</i> and St. <i>Elizabeth</i>, the Name
Days of the Emperor and Empress. The Emperor, who commonly dresses very
plain, is cover'd all over with Diamonds upon St. <i>Elizabeth</i>'s Day. And
as for the Empress, her Apparel is commonly rich, and so loaded with
Jewels upon St. <i>Charles</i>'s Day that she can scarce stand under it. Except
on these Days of <i>Gala</i> the Court dresses very plain. 'Tis true that these
Days are very frequent, and that consequently plain Clothes are not very
much wore, for if it be a Holiday, or the Birth-Day of some Minister, or
if some Lady of Distinction sends but for a Surgeon to bleed her, 'tis
enough to put the whole City in <i>Gala</i>. These <i>Gala's</i> may be divided into
three Classes; the <i>Court Gala</i> which is universal both for the Nobles and
Plebeians; the <i>Grand Gala</i> which is kept in the City is for the Festival
of some Minister; and the third and last is the <i>Little Gala</i>, which is
when the Ladies are let blood. A Husband makes a <i>Gala</i> here for his Wife,
the Wife for her Husband, the Children for their Parents, and Brothers and
Sisters for one another; so that to be sure two Thirds of <i>Vienna</i> are
<!--253.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>always
in <i>Gala</i>; which made a <i>French</i> Jester say, 'twould take up a
great deal of Brimstone to cure the <i>Austrians</i> of the <i>Gale</i><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.
However, they take care not to appear in this domestic <i>Gala</i> before the
Emperor and Empress, because it would be reckon'd a Disrespect to them.</p>

<p>On the great Festival-Days the Emperor goes with a grand Retinue to St.
<i>Stephen</i>'s Cathedral: He takes up one whole Side of the Coach, and the
Empress sits fronting him. Their Majesties are preceded by the
Chamberlains and Knights of the <i>Golden Fleece</i> on horseback: The Pages
and Footmen walk bare-headed immediately after the Coach of the Master of
the Horse, and their Imperial Majesties Coach is guarded on each side by a
File of Archers, and attended by the Coaches of the Arch-Duchesses and the
Ladies. Then the Horse-Guards appear with their Kettle-Drums and Trumpets,
and the March is clos'd by the Pope's <i>Nuncio</i> and the Ambassadors with
their Train, which consists of three magnificent Coaches and six Horses
each.</p>

<p>On <i>Corpus Christi</i> Day the Emperor accompanies the Holy Sacrament, when
the Streets thro' which the Procession passes are cover'd with Planks.
Their Imperial Majesties repair in the Morning with great Attendance to
St. <i>Stephen</i>'s Cathedral, and after assisting at Divine Service join in
the Procession. The Emperor is immediately follow'd by the Empress, who is
accompany'd by all the Ladies in rich Dresses, which renders this one of
the most magnificent Processions in the World.</p>

<p>The same Honours and Respects are paid to the Empress Dowager as to the
Empress Regent. She has her separate Houshold, and her own Guards. She has
an Apartment in the Palace, but commonly lives in a Convent of her own
founding in one of the Suburbs, and does not come to Town except on the
great Festivals or for some extraordinary
Function.<!--254.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
You know, without
doubt, that the Empress Dowagers can never quit Mourning; their Apartments
must be always hung with Black, and their Coaches and Liveries are of the
same Colour: Nor can they be present at any Play, Ball, or Concert. In
short by losing their Husbands they must renounce the Pleasures of this
Life. These severe Obligations on a Widow are fully discharg'd by the
Empress Dowager. Being retir'd to a Convent where she is almost
continually prostrate before the Altars in Prayer and Supplication, she
makes her Mansion a Place of Piety and Peace, and never appears in public
but when Conveniency requires. This Princess was always an Example of the
most uncommon Virtue. In the Life-time of her Husband the Emperor
<i>Joseph</i>, she lov'd Pleasures and Grandeur; but when she became a Widow
she renounc'd all, and only employ'd herself in Works of Piety, and in the
Education of the two Arch-Duchesses her Daughters, whom she has now the
Comfort of seeing marry'd to two powerful Princes of the Empire<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.
There's not a Person that draws near her Imperial Majesty but admires her
eminent Qualities. I have not yet had the Honour this Journey of casting
my self at her Feet, but the first Time I was here I had the Advantage of
paying my Duty to her at <i>Schonborn</i>, where she then pass'd the Summer. I
was receiv'd by her with such Proofs of her Kindness as charm'd me, and
which I shall always remember with Pleasure and Respect. This Princess is
the Daughter of <i>John-Frederic</i> Duke of <i>Brunswic-Hanover</i> and of
<i>Henrietta-Benedictine</i> Princess Palatine. After the Death of the Duke her
Father, who left no Son, she went with the Duchess of <i>Brunswic</i> to
<i>France</i>, where this Princess was very glad to retire to her Sister the
Princess of <i>Condé</i>. The Empress who
was<!--255.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
then the Princess <i>Amelia</i>,
spent some Years in <i>France</i>, where she learned the Language and
Politeness of that Nation to perfection, and in short acquir'd that Merit
and Virtue for which she is now so much admir'd, and which perhaps have
contributed equally with her illustrious Extraction to gain her possession
of the first Throne in Christendom. The Marriage of her elder Sister to
<i>Renaud d'Este</i> Duke of <i>Modena</i> obliging the Dutchess of <i>Brunswic</i> to
leave <i>France</i>, and go and settle at <i>Modena</i>, the Princess <i>Amelia</i>
follow'd her also into <i>Italy</i>. She had no reason to be sorry for her
leaving <i>France</i>, and rejecting the Addresses of a <i>French</i> Nobleman who
had presum'd to court her, for not long after her Arrival at <i>Modena</i> she
was marry'd to the King of the <i>Romans</i>, afterwards the Emperor <i>Joseph</i>.
This Empress is not only endow'd with the Christian but all the Moral
Virtues, and there are few Princesses of a more generous Soul, of greater
Courage, or of a Genius more sublime, more refin'd, or more adorn'd. There
was a Time when she might be rank'd among the most beautiful Princesses of
<i>Europe</i>: she still retains all the Marks of it; and therewith preserves
such a majestic Air that whenever I behold her it revives the profound
Veneration I have for her sacred Person.</p>

<p>The Emperor <i>Charles</i> VI. is of a middling Stature, and in good Plight of
Body: He is of a swarthy hale Complection, has a brisk Eye, and thick
Lips, for which last his Family in general have been remarkable. This
Monarch is the second Son of the Emperor <i>Leopold</i> by <i>Eleonora</i> of
<i>Newbourg</i>, and the fifteenth Emperor<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of his Family. Being design'd
when a Minor for Successor to <i>Charles</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>, he had a
grave Education suitable to the People whom he was one day to govern. This
<!--256.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>made
him contract an Air of Seriousness, which, to those who have not the
Honour of Access to him, favours of Severity; yet he is affable and very
humane. He hears those with Attention that speak to him, and his Answers
are full of Good-nature. When he attain'd to an Age hardly ripe enough for
the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, he met with various Fortune in that Kingdom; but he
supported himself in every Event with an heroic Magnanimity, being always
submissive to the Will of that Providence which he knew was the Master of
the Fortune of Kings. The Adversitys with which it pleas'd God to try his
Patience by the Siege of <i>Barcelona</i> which he carry'd on in Person, and by
the Loss of the Battle of <i>Villa Viciosa</i>, only serv'd to confirm his
Constancy, and his natural Integrity, a Principle which renders him even
more venerable than the Splendor of his Crowns and the vast Extent of his
Power. Heaven, which always rewards Virtue, has granted this Monarch one
of the best and most fortunate Reigns that any Emperor has had since
<i>Germany</i> has been the Seat of Empire. He wants nothing to crown his
Happiness but a Male Heir, which is so much the Desire of the People, as
well as of the Emperor and the most virtuous Empress the World ever saw,
that God grant he may have one.</p>

<p>This Princess is descended from the august House of <i>Brunswic</i>, to which
<i>Europe</i> is at this Time oblig'd for two Empresses<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, one King<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>, and
a Queen<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. She is the Daughter of <i>Lewis Rodolph</i> Duke of
<i>Brunswic-Blankenbourg</i><a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> by <i>Christiana-Louisa</i> Princess of <i>Oetingen</i>,
of whom I gave
you<!--257.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
an Account in my Letter from <i>Blankenbourg</i>. The
Character of this august Princess for her Affability and Goodness is so
well known in the World that 'tis needless to speak of it here. You know
likewise how beautiful and handsome she was when she was marry'd to the
Emperor. And notwithstanding the Pimples in her Face and her present
Corpulency she may still be reckon'd in the number of the beautiful
Princesses. Such an Air of Modesty, Mildness, and Majesty, accompanies
every thing she does, as inspires those that approach her with equal
Courage and Respect. Her Duty is her Law, and her principal Care is to
please the Emperor, whose Wisdom she knows to be sufficient to govern his
Dominions, and to him she therefore leaves all Affairs. Indeed she is very
earnest with him to get Favours for those who petition her, which she
thinks a Happiness to obtain, and she bestows them in such manner as is
very affecting to the Receivers. This Princess is charitable, generous,
and magnificent. She maintains her Dignity without Conceit, and supports
her solid Piety without Ostentation. She was educated in the <i>Lutheran</i>
Religion, but abjur'd it at <i>Bamberg</i> when she came thither in her Way to
be marry'd to the Emperor, then King of <i>Spain</i>, and is now a good
Catholic, yet without any Hatred to the Protestants; being convinc'd that
the Love of one's Neighbour is one of the Duties which God most strictly
enjoins upon Mankind, and that Charitableness and good Examples are the
best Means to reconcile those to the Church who are separated from it.</p>

<p>In the same sublime Sentiments of Virtue does the Empress educate the
Archduchesses her Daughters, and those young Princesses are like to make
worthy Proficients. The eldest Archduchess <i>Mary Theresa</i> is brought up in
the agreeable Prospect of being one day Mistress of the vast Dominions
possessed<!--258.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
by the Emperor<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. This young Princess has very much of the
Air of the Empress her Mother; and if Heaven designs her for the
Sovereignty of the Empire, God grant she may also resemble her in her
Virtues!</p>

<p>The Emperor has three Sisters. The eldest is the Archduchess <i>Mary
Elizabeth</i> Governess of the (<i>Austrian</i>) <i>Netherlands</i>; the second is
<i>Mary-Anne</i> Queen of <i>Portugal</i>; and the third is the Archduchess <i>Mary
Magdalen</i>, who 'tis said is intended to be Governess of <i>Tirol</i>. The
intire August House of <i>Austria</i> consists at present of the sacred Person
of the Emperor and of eight Princesses<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, of whom three are married;
and God grant it may be augmented by the Birth of a Prince; for without
setting up here for a zealous Subject, I don't think that the Houses of
<i>Austria</i> and <i>Bourbon</i> ought ever to be extinct, both of them having made
the Fortunes of an infinite Number of Gentlemen.</p>

<p>The Emperor's ordinary Pastime (when he has a Desire to unbend his Mind
from Affairs of State, to which he applies with all the Earnestness of a
Monarch that loves his People) is Hunting, or Shooting at a Mark; and the
Empress is generally a Sharer in his Diversions. His Imperial Majesty goes
sometimes also to the Riding-House, where he exercises himself in Riding:
At other times Music is his Amusement, which the Monarch not only performs
by Book, but is also a Composer; and some Years ago an Opera was acted
here of his composing. All the Actors as well as the Dancers and the
Musicians of the Orchestre were Persons of Quality. The Emperor himself
made one, and the two eldest Archduchesses his Daughters danced. The
Spectators were the Empress Regent and the Empress Dowager, and every
Actor had the
Liberty<!--259.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
of carrying two of his Kindred or intimate Friends.</p>

<p>Tho' their Imperial Majesties are very fond of Music they have seldom more
than two Operas in a Year, <i>viz.</i> on the Days of St. <i>Charles</i> and St.
<i>Elizabeth</i>, and sometimes the same Operas are play'd again during the
Carnival. At this time, which is devoted to Mirth, there is a Ball at
Court, and on the Flesh-days there is commonly a great Masquerade
representing a Country-Wedding. In the Palace there is a very magnificent
Theatre, which indeed is almost the only thing there that is worth seeing,
for the Imperial Palace is so wretched a Mansion that few Monarchs are
lodged worse than the Emperor. The Furniture too is old-fashion'd and not
very rich, which is somewhat unaccountable, because the Wardrobes are full
of costly Pieces of Tapestry, stately Pictures, and other fine Goods which
probably they are restrained from making use of by the <i>Etiquette</i>. The
Emperor's Pleasure-Houses are no better than his Palace in the City. The
Castle of the <i>Favorita</i> which is in one of the Suburbs, is a great
Building full of Turnings and Windings like the Street which it looks
into, and has more of the Appearance of a great Convent of <i>Capuchin</i>
Fryars than of the Dwelling of a Prince who is the Head of so many
Sovereigns. The Gardens are as mean as the House, and only considerable
for their Extent. <i>Laxembourg</i> is still very much inferior to the
<i>Favorita</i>; but the Court is there no more than a Month or six Weeks,
during the Hunting of the Heron. The Ministers that are obliged to attend
the Emperor thither have Houses there, which though not very grand, are
commodious. When a Person goes to <i>Laxembourg</i> to pay a Visit to the Court
he is under a Necessity of returning to <i>Vienna</i> for a Bed, which is a
very great Inconveniency.</p>

<!--260.png--><p><span class="pagenum">235</span></p>

<p>The Emperor <i>Joseph</i> had begun a very fine House at <i>Schonborn</i> about a
League from <i>Vienna</i>, but did not live to finish it; and the Empress
<i>Amelia</i> to whom the Emperor gave it, instead of carrying on the Works
which her Husband had begun, lets it run to ruin; which is great pity, for
if that Building had been finish'd the Emperor wou'd not have had a
<i>Versailles</i>, but he wou'd at least have had a Mansion-House suitable to
his Dignity. 'Tis said that a new Palace is going to be built for the
Emperor; which, if true, 'twere to be wish'd that better Architects may be
employ'd in it than those who have had the Direction of the new Stables
and of St. <i>Charles</i>'s Church, which are Buildings lately erected with
very great Expence, but without any Taste. The Stables are a Range of
Buildings of a vast Length, divided into seven Pavilions which appear at
first sight to be so many different Houses. The middlemost Pavilion which
is design'd to lodge the Master of the Horse is much higher than the other
six, which sink gradually on the two sides. Nor are the inner Rooms better
contriv'd; for the Horses stand all in one Row, and the Stable is so
narrow withal, that one is every Minute in danger from the Horses Heels;
which is purely owing to the Indiscretion of the Architect, who having
ground enough and to spare might for the same Expence have made something
grand and noble.</p>

<p>Whether the same Architect that built the Stables had the Direction
likewise of St. <i>Charles</i>'s Church, is what I know not; but if they are
two different Men their Head-pieces are very much alike. This Church would
perhaps have been admir'd in the Days of the <i>Goths</i>, but in so refined an
Age as the present, one cannot look on it without being sorry for the Sums
of Money laid out in it.</p>

<p>This bad Taste as to Buildings prevails too much at <i>Vienna</i>, not but that
there are Hotels and
even<!--261.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Palaces in which the Rules of Architecture are
observ'd, but then the Builders are got into such a way of ornamenting and
charging their Houses with Sculpture as is altogether contrary to the
noble Simplicity of the ancient Architecture. The Palace of Prince
<i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i> is stately, but situate in a narrow Street with a very
little Court before it. The Stair-case is very well contriv'd were it not
too much confin'd. The Apartments of the first Story are as well laid out
as the Ground wou'd admit of. We enter first into a spacious Salon adorn'd
with great Pictures representing the chief Victories of Prince <i>Eugene</i>
over the <i>French</i> and the <i>Turks</i>. In the two Rooms next to this are very
rich Hangings wherein the Maker <i>Devos</i> at <i>Brussels</i> has very correctly
delineated the whole Military Science. The Bed-chamber beyond that has a
Set of Furniture of green Velvet richly embroider'd with Gold and Silk. In
the same Room there is a Lustre of Rock Crystal which is said to have cost
40,000 Florins. All the other Furniture is extraordinary magnificent, and
wou'd be cry'd up at <i>Paris</i> it self, where it must be allow'd a Taste for
fine Furniture prevails more than any where.</p>

<p>The Palace of <i>Lichtenstein</i> is bigger than that of <i>Savoy</i>, and not less
magnificent. 'Tis worth seeing were it only for its Paintings. I pass over
the Hotels of <i>Schwartzenberg</i>, <i>Daun</i>, <i>Diedrichstein</i>, <i>Harrach</i>, and
several other noble Edifices, lest my Letter shou'd swell into a Volume.</p>

<p>The Palaces of the Suburbs are infinitely more grand than those of the
City, and they have both Court-yards and Gardens. The most noble are the
Palaces of <i>Trautsheim</i>, <i>Rofrano</i>, <i>Schwartzenberg</i>, <i>Altheim</i>, and
<i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i>. This last especially is a superb Structure with
magnificent Gardens, a fine Orangery, and a Menagery stor'd with the most
uncommon Creatures that the four Parts
of<!--262.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
the World can furnish. 'Tis in
this fine great House that Prince <i>Eugene</i> passes the beautiful Season of
the Year. There is not so fine a Sight as an Assembly at this Prince's
House, for not only the outer Court, in which there's a fine Piece of
Water, but the Gardens are illuminated by an infinite Number of Lanthorns
made in form of a Bowl of extraordinary white Glass, which cast a very
great Light and make a glorious appearance. The Assembles at this Prince's
House are always very numerous; for his Birth, Employments and Interest,
draw a great Court to him.</p>

<p>Prince <i>Eugene</i> is of a middling Stature, and well made. His Air is
extremely serious, and his Deportment grave and reserv'd; but
notwithstanding that Reservedness he is a hearty Friend to his Adherents.
He is a thorough Judge of Merit, and loves to distinguish it. He is
perfectly genteel and civil, very polite to the Ladies, respectful and
submissive to his Lord and Master, but without Flattery or Servility. He
is generous and noble in every thing excepting his Apparel. He is an Enemy
to Ostentation, Ceremonies, and Constraint. In his youthful Days he lov'd
Pleasures, but he abandon'd them as soon as he was animated with a Thirst
for Glory. He was born in <i>France</i>, but left that Kingdom in 1683, out of
disgust that he was no more taken notice of, and came to <i>Vienna</i> just
before the <i>Turks</i> laid siege to it. He made the Campaign as a Volunteer,
and distinguish'd himself in such a manner that the Emperor <i>Leopold</i> gave
him in <i>December</i> following that Regiment of Dragoons which still goes by
his Name. When the Siege of <i>Vienna</i> was rais'd, he serv'd in <i>Hungary</i>
under Duke <i>Charles</i> of <i>Lorrain</i>, and <i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i> Elector of
<i>Bavaria</i>. The first time that he obtain'd the Command of the Imperial
Army was in 1697, when he began with the Victory at <i>Zenta</i> whereby 22,000
<i>Turks</i> lost their Lives; a Loss which they could not
recover,<!--263.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and which
put them upon suing for the Peace that was granted to them at <i>Carlowitz</i>
in 1699. The Prince afterwards commanded in <i>Italy</i>, <i>Germany</i>,
<i>Flanders</i>, and lastly in <i>Hungary</i>; and wherever he went Conquest
attended him. To give you a Detail of his Achievements would be to
anticipate the <i>History</i> which is to immortalize them, and to which you
will not take it ill if I refer you. As to the Dignities and great
Employments of this Prince, he is Chief Counsellor of the Council of
Conferences; President of the Aulic Council of War; Commander in Chief or
Lieutenant-General of the Armies of the Emperor and Empire; his Imperial
Majesty's Vicar-General in <i>Italy</i>; Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons; and
Knight of the Golden Fleece. All his Employments may be worth about
300,000 Florins a year to him. Besides this, he has a considerable Estate
in <i>Hungary</i> and in the Neighbourhood of <i>Vienna</i>, which brings him in
about 100,000 Florins <i>per Ann.</i> more. He holds those Lands by the
Emperor's Bounty who gave them to him as a Reward for his important
Services.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<!--264.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>The Marshal Count <i>Guido Staremberg</i> is one of those Gentlemen also who
deserve particular respect for their Virtue. He is descended of a Family
which has given great Generals and wise Ministers to the Emperors of the
<i>Austrian</i> Family, and has supported the Glory of his Ancestors in a
signal manner; <i>Hungary</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and <i>Spain</i>, have been Witnesses of
Bravery and consummate Wisdom in the Art of commanding Armies, and have
admir'd him the more because they saw him always gaining Victories with
Armies ill paid, destitute of all Necessaries, and very much inferior to
his Enemies. This General enter'd very young into the Service in quality
of an Ensign, and advanc'd himself by degrees. He was made
Lieutenant-Colonel a little before the <i>Turks</i> Undertaking against
<i>Vienna</i>, and while it was besieg'd, serv'd as Adjutant to his Cousin
<i>Ernest-Rudiger</i> Count <i>de Staremberg</i>, the Defender of <i>Vienna</i>. This
Count <i>Guido</i>, after having been a few years in the Service, was preferr'd
to the Regiment of Foot of which he is still
Colonel.<!--265.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
When he was very
young he was made Great <i>Commander</i> of the <i>Teutonic</i> Order. I do not
mention his Exploits to you, because they are so much celebrated by Fame
that you cannot but know them. This General, tho' very much advanc'd in
years, retains all his juvenile Ardor, and wou'd still be very capable of
commanding.</p>

<p>Having mention'd two of the Emperor's greatest Generals you will not be
sorry, I fancy, if I shou'd give you some Account also of his chief
Ministers. They are five in Number, and are call'd <i>Counsellors of the
Conferences</i>. Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i> is the first Counsellor, but
without the Title of Prime Minister, that being a Dignity not known at the
Imperial Court.</p>

<p>The Count <i>Lewis de Zinzendorf</i>, Chancellor of the Court, and Knight of
the <i>Golden Fleece</i>, is the second Counsellor of the Conference. He is a
Nobleman descended of a Family which has been for a long time eminent in
<i>Austria</i>. His Mother was a Princess of <i>Holstein</i>, who married to her
second Husband the Marshal Count <i>de Rabutin</i> Governor of <i>Transylvania</i>,
but died a few years ago in a very advanc'd Age. I had the honour to know
her the last time I was here; her House being the Rendezvous of all People
of Rank. Count <i>Zinzendorf</i> was in the Ministry in the Reign of <i>Leopold</i>.
He was that Emperor's Minister Plenipotentiary in <i>France</i>, while the
Marshal <i>de Villars</i> was at <i>Vienna</i> with the same Character from <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. At the Death of the Emperor <i>Joseph</i>, the Count <i>de Zinzendorf</i> was
that Prince's Ambassador to the States-General, in which Character he was
confirmed by the Empress <i>Eleonora</i> who was Regent during the Absence of
King <i>Charles</i>. He repaired from the <i>Hague</i> to <i>Frankfort</i> to assist at
the Coronation of <i>Charles</i> VI. and officiated at the Ceremony as Vicar to
the Great Treasurer of the Empire, a Dignity which is Hereditary in his
Family.<!--266.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
At the Congress of <i>Utrecht</i> which was open'd not long after, the
Count <i>de Zinzendorf</i> assisted as the Emperor's first Ambassador. He
afterwards went to the unsuccessful Congress of <i>Soissons</i>, and from
thence to <i>Versailles</i>, where he succeeded so well with the Cardinal <i>de
Fleury</i>, that he kept him tight in those pacific Sentiments which the
Enemies of his Tranquillity, if not of his Glory, aim'd to make him give
up. The Count is now return'd hither, and almost the only Man that acts in
the Province of foreign Affairs. His Interest is very great, for besides
the Esteem which the Emperor has for his Person and Services, he is
related to all the most distinguished Persons at Court, and strictly
attached to the Interest of Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i>, of whose Integrity
and disinterested Zeal for the Emperor he is very sensible. The Count <i>de
Zinzendorf</i> is pretty tall and has a happy engaging Aspect. His Deportment
is noble. He is pretty reserv'd, but civil. He is very polite to
Strangers, and his House is open to them. He keeps the noblest and most
elegant Table at <i>Vienna</i>. He is magnificent in every thing he does, and
all his Actions favour of the Man of Quality. He is Father of a numerous
Family. The second of his Sons is a Cardinal and Bishop in <i>Hungary</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.
Another is Knight of <i>Malta</i>, and Lieutenant-Colonel. As these are the two
with whom I am best acquainted, so they are the only ones I shall mention.
I know not whether 'tis possible for a Man to be more sprightly than they
both are. The Chevalier has more Mettle and Life than a <i>Gascon</i>: He is
very blunt in his witty Sallies, but the variety of them pleases, and
their novelty and justness are surprizing.</p>

<p>The Count <i>Gundacker de Staremberg</i>, President of the Chamber of Finances,
and Knight of
the<!--267.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Golden Fleece, is the third Counsellor of the
Conferences. His Integrity is very much cry'd up, and he has manag'd the
Finances in such a manner as to guard against the Public Hatred.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Schonborn</i>, Bishop of <i>Bamberg</i> and <i>Wurtzbourg</i>,
Vice-Chancellor of the Empire, is the fourth Counsellor of the
Conferences<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. You know, Sir, that the <i>Schonborn</i> Family has given us
several worthy Gentlemen; but I may venture to say, with all due Regard to
the Memory of those great Men, and without flattering the Vice-Chancellor,
that of all the Family he has the greatest Capacity for Business, the most
generous Temper, and the most engaging and most civil Behaviour. As this
Prelate has not his Equal at <i>Vienna</i> for Grandeur and Riches, so he has
not his Fellow for Magnificence. The Emperor has a singular Esteem for
him. The Vice-Chancellor has the Chancery of the Empire under him, and no
body above him but the Emperor, and the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>, who is the
Great Chancellor of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Konigseck</i>, Vice-President of the Aulic Council of War, is
the fifth Counsellor of the Conferences. This Nobleman, whose Extraction
is from a Family of Distinction in the Empire, is one of the tallest and
handsomest Men at Court: He is the Emperor's Ambassador Extraordinary at
the Court of <i>Spain</i>. His Family has for a long time past been attach'd to
the House of <i>Austria</i>. He studied at <i>Besançon</i>, and was design'd for the
Church; but he quitted the Band, took to
Arms,<!--268.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
and enter'd into the
Service of the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>; in which he had not been many Years
before he had a Regiment of Foot, and the Emperor <i>Joseph</i> made him his
Chamberlain. He also gave him the Government of <i>Mantua</i>, from whence he
was recall'd by <i>Charles</i> VI. and sent to take possession of the
<i>Netherlands</i> in the Name of the Emperor, to whom they were evacuated for
that purpose by the Maritime Powers. The Count <i>de Konigseck</i>, during his
Administration of the <i>Netherlands</i>, concluded the Barrier Treaty with the
States-General. At <i>Brussels</i> he married Madamoiselle <i>de Lanoi la
Motterie</i>, a young Lady of a good Family, and distinguish'd Merit. When he
left the <i>Netherlands</i> he went Ambassador from the Emperor to the Court of
<i>France</i>, where he gain'd great Esteem, especially from the Duke of
<i>Orleans</i>, the Regent; a Prince who was an excellent Judge of Merit, and
very sparing of his Applause. After three Years stay at <i>Paris</i>, the Count
return'd to <i>Vienna</i>. He attended the Archduchess, Wife to the Electoral
Prince of <i>Saxony</i>, in quality of Steward, to <i>Dresden</i>; and at his return
went to the Government of <i>Transilvania</i>. But the Emperor recall'd him
from this Post and sent him his Ambassador Extraordinary to <i>Spain</i>; where
the Count is as much esteem'd as he was at <i>Paris</i>. 'Tis said that he is
in entire Favour with their Catholic Majesties; nevertheless he makes such
earnest Application to be recall'd, that 'tis said he will obtain his
Request, and that his Nephew<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, who is the Emperor's Minister
Plenipotentiary to the States-General, is already nominated to relieve
him<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<!--269.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>In the Council of Conferences the most important Affairs of the Empire are
taken into Consideration, and the Emperor is always present.</p>

<p>Besides the five Ministers whom I have now mention'd to you, there are
several others whose Interest is more circumscrib'd. Every Kingdom subject
to the Emperor has its Minister and particular Chancery.</p>

<p>Count <i>Badiani</i> directs the Affairs of <i>Hungary</i>, in quality of its
Vice-Chancellor.</p>

<p>The Affairs of <i>Bohemia</i> are in the Province of Count <i>Kinski</i>, the
Chancellor of that Kingdom, who has a Vice-Chancellor under him, with a
great many Assessors and Counsellors.</p>

<p>The Council of <i>Spain</i> consists of a President, Vice-President, and
Counsellors. Its Authority extends over all the Kingdoms that were
formerly subject to <i>Spain</i>, but yielded to the Emperor by the Peace. The
Count <i>de Monte-Santo</i>, a Grandee of <i>Spain</i>, Brother to the Count <i>de
Cinfuentes</i>, Constable of <i>Castile</i>, is President of this Council<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; in
which Office he succeeded the Archbishop of <i>Valentia</i>, who quitted his
See to follow the Emperor whom he had acknowledg'd for his Sovereign in
<i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the Tribunals at <i>Vienna</i> the <i>Aulic Council</i> is the most
venerable; because 'tis the Parliament of the Empire. It is compos'd of a
President,
<i>viz.</i><!--270.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the Count <i>de Wurmbrandt</i>; a Vice-President, who is the
Count <i>de Metsch</i>; and of eighteen Counsellors, among whom there must be
six Protestants, and of these one must be a <i>Calvinist</i>. This Tribunal
judges of all Civil Causes between the Princes and private Men of the
Empire. Its Authority terminates with the Emperor's Life; and 'tis on this
account only that the supreme Tribunal of <i>Wetzlar</i>, which subsists even
during the Vacancy of the Imperial Throne, challenges Precedence of the
Aulic Council. 'Tis a Mistake to think, as many Foreigners do, that the
Aulic Council takes Cognizance of Affairs of State; for its sole Business
is to do Justice: It registers no Edict unless it be its own
Sentences<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>; and is much more limited than the Parliaments of <i>France</i>,
which have at least the Privilege of losing Time in Remonstrances.</p>

<p>I perceive too that I am in a fair way to make you lose a great deal, if I
don't put an end to my Legend; which therefore I now do, and refer the
rest of the Remarks that I have to entertain you with to another Post.</p>

<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>There are some other Articles which I cannot but add to those I have
already given you from <i>Vienna</i>. The Police of this City is administer'd
by a Stadtholder. The Person that now fills that Post is the Count <i>de
Kehvenhuller</i>; who is also a Minister of State, and Knight of the Golden
Fleece. His Functions are the same with those of the Lieutenant of the
Police at <i>Paris</i>, and nothing makes the Difference but the Title; only it
must be observ'd that the Stadtholder is always a Person of noble
Extraction, and a Gentleman of the Army, whereas the Lieutenant of the
Police at <i>Paris</i> is often of mean Extraction, but always a Gentleman of
the long Robe.</p>

<p>The Governour of <i>Vienna</i> had seldom any other Title than <i>Colonel of the
City</i>. The present Governour is the Marshal Count <i>de Daun</i>, the same that
defended <i>Turin</i>, who was six Years Viceroy of <i>Naples</i>, six Months
Governour of the <i>Netherlands</i>, and afterwards four Years Governour of
<i>Milan</i><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. His Lieutenant-Colonel, who is the Count <i>Maximilian de
Staremberg</i>, Lieutenant-General of the Emperor's Forces, and Colonel of a
Regiment of Foot, commands in his absence, and has the
Direction<!--272.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of the
Fortifications, the Arsenal, and the Garison. This Garison consists of a
Regiment of Foot, compos'd of veteran Soldiers, or the Burghers and
Artificers of <i>Vienna</i>, from whence this Regiment never stirs. The
Employments in this Corps are very lucrative; but as they don't lie in the
Road to the Temple of Honour, they are not much solicited by Persons of
any considerable Extraction. Yet this Regiment, as little esteem'd as it
is, perform'd very good Services during the Siege of <i>Vienna</i> by <i>Kara
Mustapha</i>, Grand Vizier to <i>Mahomet</i> IV. It acted then under
<i>Ernest-Rudiger</i> Count <i>de Staremberg</i>, who was Commandant in the City;
and both the General and his Garison acquir'd very great Glory by the
Resistance which they made. But perhaps with all their Bravery they cou'd
not have prevented the Place from being taken, had it not been for the
Avarice of the Grand Vizier, who hoped to be Master himself of the vast
Treasures that he knew were in the City, and was therefore against
storming the Town, for fear lest if it were carry'd by that means, the
Soldiers would have shar'd the Plunder.</p>

<p>The Siege of <i>Vienna</i> being foreign to my purpose, I shall say nothing of
it. You know that it was raised by the Assistance that was brought to it
by the brave <i>John Sobieski</i> King of <i>Poland</i>; who defeated the <i>Turks</i> on
the 12th of <i>September</i>, 1683, and return'd home laden with Glory and
Booty, having made himself Master of all the Grand Vizier's Equipage. Upon
this occasion he said a pleasant thing in a Letter which he wrote to the
Queen his Wife, who had not a very implicit Faith in the Maxims of
<i>Seneca</i> on the Contempt of Riches; 'You shan't say when I come home, as
the <i>Tartary</i> Women do to their Husbands when they return from the Army
without Booty, <i>You are not a Man for me, because you come empty-handed</i>;
for
the<!--273.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Grand Vizier has made me sole Heir of all he had.'</p>

<p>You need not be told that this was the second time the <i>Turks</i> were forc'd
to raise the Siege of <i>Vienna</i>; for <i>Soliman</i> the Sultan besieg'd it in
the Reign of <i>Charles</i> V. but with no better Success than <i>Kara Mustapha</i>.
'Tis true that the Disappointment he met with was not so fatal in its
Consequence to the Sultan as the other was to the Vizier of <i>Mahomet</i> IV.
who was strangled at <i>Belgrade</i> when <i>Mahomet</i> was there: And the Head of
this Minister is still to be seen in the Arsenal at <i>Vienna</i>. The
Translation of this <i>Turkish</i> Relique hither from <i>Belgrade</i> was pretty
extraordinary. Some Years after <i>Kara Mustapha</i> had been strangled, when
the <i>Germans</i> took <i>Belgrade</i>, the Soldiers being inform'd where the Grand
Vizier was buried, open'd his Tomb in hopes of Treasure, but found nothing
except the Body in its Shirt, on which there were several <i>Arabic</i>
Characters, and an Alcoran. The Governour being told of it, remember'd
that this very Grand Vizier, when he laid Siege to <i>Raab</i>, which he was
oblig'd to raise, said, That if he took the Town he wou'd have the Head of
its Bishop cut off, who was then the Count <i>Leopold de Collonitz</i>, and
send it to the Sultan, to be reveng'd of that Prelate for taking Money out
of the Convents, and encouraging the Garison therewith to make a vigorous
Resistance. The Governour of <i>Belgrade</i> remembring, I say, the Menaces of
the Grand Vizier, thought it wou'd be a very agreeable Present to the
Count <i>de Collonitz</i>, now a Cardinal<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, to send him the Vizier's Head
and Body too, together with the Shirt and Alcoran; and he put up the whole
very neatly in a Crystal Shrine, adorn'd with Silver Plates, and sent it
accordingly to his Eminence; who not thinking this odd Present a proper
Relique to be deposited in his Chapel, gave it to the Arsenal here at
<!--274.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span><i>Vienna</i>,
where I have both seen the Mussulman and felt him. I wou'd fain
have pluck'd some of the Hairs of his Mustachio, but the Guardian of the
precious Treasure watch'd my Fingers too narrowly. They say that a piece
of the Halter by which a Man hangs himself is lucky, and why mayn't there
be the same Virtue in the Mustachio of the Grand Vizier? Be it so or not,
'twill always deserve an honourable Station in some Cabinet of Rarities.</p>

<p>Since the Siege of <i>Vienna</i> this City is much inlarg'd. Its Fortifications
are so augmented too that if the <i>Turks</i> should ever be prompted by their
ill Fate to besiege it again, they wou'd find a stouter Resistance, and a
greater number of their Mustachios sindged than they imagine.</p>

<p>The Emperor has lately given new Lustre to his Capital, by prevailing with
Pope <i>Benedict</i> XIII. to erect it into an Archbishopric. Several Bishops,
particularly the Archbishop of <i>Passaw</i>, have dismember'd their Dioceses
to aggrandise its Jurisdiction. The Cardinal <i>de Collonitz</i> is the Person
who at present enjoys this Dignity, which gives him the Character and Rank
of a Prince.</p>

<p>The <i>Roman</i> Catholic is the only Religion exercis'd in <i>Vienna</i>, and in
all <i>Austria</i>; but the Ministers of the Protestant Crown'd Heads have the
Liberty here, as well as elsewhere, of keeping a Chapel. When the holy
Sacrament or the Viaticum is carried to any sick Person, 'tis always
attended by Guards who oblige all People that meet it to kneel. I have
seen the Emperor, when the Viaticum was passing by, alight out of his
Coach and accompany it to Church. This Prince, and indeed all those of his
Family, always paid a very great Devotion to the holy Sacrament of the
Altar. Of this <i>Philip</i> IV. King of <i>Spain</i> gave a very edifying Proof;
for this Monarch going the very day that the King his Father died, from
the Palace of <i>Madrid</i> to the Monastery of St. <i>Jeronimo del Passo</i> in a
close Coach, that he
might<!--275.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
be <i>incog.</i> alighted out of it to accompany
the Viaticum which they were carrying to a sick Man; whereupon the Condé
Duke <i>d'Olivarez</i> told him, That the King his Father was so lately dead
that he ought not to have been seen in public. <i>My Lord</i>, said the King,
<i>this Custom cannot excuse me from paying that Worship to God which I owe
him</i>.</p>

<p>It may be said of the august House of <i>Austria</i>, That as few Princes equal
them in Piety, so there are few that equal them in Birth. There may be
Families that have been longer grac'd with the Diadem; but of these there
are very few that have such great Alliances. There is no King, and not
many Sovereign Princes but what are related to them; and there are very
few Kingdoms to which the House of <i>Austria</i> has not given Queens. 'Tis
now 300 Years that it has been Mistress of the Empire; and since <i>Albert</i>
II. it has given thirteen Emperors to <i>Europe</i> successively. One of the
Princesses of <i>Austria</i> had so many great Relations that I cannot help
mentioning her. This was the Empress <i>Mary</i>, Wife to the Emperor
<i>Maximilian</i>, Son to <i>Ferdinand</i> I. This Princess was Sister to <i>Philip</i>
II. King of <i>Spain</i>, and the Daughter, the Wife, the Daughter-in-law, and
the Mother of five Emperors; the Grand-daughter, the Daughter, the Sister,
and the Aunt of four Kings of <i>Spain</i>; and the Mother-in-law of two Kings,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Charles</i> IX. King of <i>France</i>, and <i>Philip</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>. A
modern Author says, that the Origin and Kindred of this Princess
infinitely surpassed those of <i>Agrippina</i>, who, according to the Report of
<i>Tacitus</i>, was the Daughter of <i>Germanicus</i>, the Sister of <i>Caligula</i>, the
Wife of <i>Claudius</i>, and the Mother of <i>Nero</i>. But when I consider how
perfect a Master you are, both of History and Genealogy, I ought to beg
your pardon for my Impertinence in troubling you with these Instances.</p>

<!--276.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>What remains for me now, is to communicate some Remarks to you which I
have made upon the <i>Austrians</i> in general. I shall begin with the Women,
whom I shall paint to you, as <i>Burrhus</i> says, with the Freedom of a
Soldier, who is not the best Limner.</p>

<p>The Women here, as in all other Countries, are either handsome or ugly. In
general they are rather handsome than pretty, for they are dull Beauties.
They are all tall and well shap'd; they walk well, but when they curt'sy,
do it in such an aukward manner, that one would think their Backs were in
danger of breaking. In their Dress they affect Finery rather than a good
Fancy. Two or three excepted, there's none that lay on the Red, much less
the White, and Patches are very little worn; in a word, they have nothing
about them that denotes Coquettry. As to their Humour, they are reckon'd
frank, tho' not easily made familiar; they are naturally vain, and like
all our <i>German</i> Women, pretty reserv'd, and not so fond of Gallantry as
they are of Gaming, Luxury, and Magnificence. Such is their Indolence that
they concern themselves no more about their Houshold Affairs than if they
were Strangers. They know no Books but their Prayer-Books, are extremely
credulous, and give into all the Externals of Religion: This makes their
Conversation sometimes insipid; and unless now and then a Love-Story falls
in, Rain and Fair-Weather are their general Topics. They have at least as
great a Conceit of <i>Vienna</i> as the <i>Parisians</i> have of <i>Paris</i>; for out of
<i>Vienna</i> they think there's no Salvation. But all these little Defects are
repair'd by an uncommon Greatness of Soul, and Generosity. They are hearty
Friends, and warm Protectors of those whose Interests they espouse. When
they are in love, their Passion is sincere; and instead of ruining their
Lovers, there are some who
have<!--277.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
made the Fortunes of those to whom they
have taken a Fancy. Upon this Head I have been told, that in the Reign of
the Emperor <i>Joseph</i>, when Gallantry was more in vogue than 'tis now,
there was a Lady, who being in love with a Gentleman, and having a mind to
make his Fortune without the Censure of the Public, thought fit in an
Assembly where her Spark cut at Basset, to punt against him. She set a
Bett, without telling a Soul how much she stak'd. Her Husband coming into
the Room where they were at play, she rose up, took the Marks that were
against her, threw them on the Ground, and said to the Banker, loud enough
to be heard by her Husband, <i>I owe you, <span class="f">Sir</span>, 40000 Florins</i>. The Husband
in a very great Surprize ask'd what was the matter? <i>I have been such a
Fool</i>, said she, pointing to the Banker, <i>as to lose 40000 Florins to
<span class="f">Monsieur N&mdash;&mdash;</span>. You have reason to chide me; but however my Debt must be
paid</i>. The Husband indeed grumbled very much, and said he wou'd not pay.
<i>What!</i> reply'd the Wife, <i>won't you pay the Gentleman? It shall fare the
worse with you if you don't, for I am resolv'd to pay him in some Coin or
other</i>. The Husband perceiving his Wife so resolute, and that if he did
not deposite the Money it wou'd subject him to the Loss of what was more
precious, chose rather to part with the Cash; and indeed he had no reason
to repent of it, for the Lady's Heart was so won by it, that she renounc'd
the Sight of her Lover from that Moment, and made a very sober Wife.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is all I have to give you concerning the Temper of the Women.
Let me tell you also how they spend their Time. They rise late. As soon
almost as their Eyes are open, they call for Chocolate, and send to their
Husbands to know who they have invited to Dinner, and whether there is
room for any more Guests. If the Lady
does<!--278.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
not like the Company, she
sends notice to some Lady of her Acquaintance that she intends to dine
with her; but if there be room at home, as a polite Husband always takes
care to leave some at the Disposal of his Wife, she sends an Invitation to
whom she pleases. After this she dresses and goes to Mass; for here the
Ladies are all so devout that there's none but what hears at least one
Mass in a day. There they read in five or six different Prayer-Books, kiss
all the Pictures that are at the head of the Prayers, and very devoutly
toss their Beads. After the Office is over, they commonly chat a quarter
of an Hour in the Church. Then they go abroad and make some friendly
Visits, or else go home to receive them. At these Visits, they hear all
the News in <i>Vienna</i>. During this they have all a little Box of <i>Indian</i>
Lack upon their Knees, in which they thread Gold till Dinner-time. When
that's over, they drink Coffee or play at <i>Quinze</i> till Night, when they
go to Court. From the Empress's Apartment they adjourn to the Assembly,
where they divert themselves at <i>Piquet</i>, or at <i>Quadrille</i>; and then
retire, undress themselves, go to Supper, and thence to Bed, well pleased
to think with what Indolence and Idleness they have spent the Day.</p>

<p>The Women of the second Class, in which I include the Gentlewomen that
have no Titles of Honour, <i>viz.</i> the Wives of the Assessors, Referendaries
and Agents of the Court, discover such an Air of Plenty and Prosperity as
is remarkably surprizing. Their Houses are richly furnished, and their
Tables well served. If a Referendary has a mind to a nice bit, no body
must offer to take it; and the best of every thing is what they are sure
to lay hands on. Belly Cheer is one of those things which the <i>Austrians</i>
generally think of most: They require a great many Dishes, and those
well-cramm'd.<!--279.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
They are so very much accustom'd to this Profusion of
Eatables that I have known some young People in <i>Austria</i> affirm they
don't know what good Eating is in <i>France</i>, because they don't serve up a
couple of Loins of Veal in one Dish. Different sorts of Wines are what
they are also very much us'd to, which certainly is very expensive because
foreign Wines pay considerable Duties; yet nothing less will serve them
than eight or ten sorts of Wine, and I have been at Houses where there
have been no less than eighteen. They place a Note upon every Plate
expressing the several sorts of Wine at the Beaufet.</p>

<p>The Burghers and common sort of People mimick the Nobility as far as their
Purses will afford; and it may be said that no Nation in the World is so
extravagant as this.</p>

<p>The <i>Austrians</i> are naturally proud and haughty, and expect all Mankind
should stoop to them. As their Sovereign is in the first Rank among the
Christian Princes, so they think theirs to be the chief Nation in the
World. Nothing is more vain nor more insupportable than a young
<i>Austrian</i>, whose Father is in any Rank at Court. They are intoxicated
with Pride and Presumption; and as they know themselves to be rich, and
their Fathers to be great Lords, they think they may despise all the
World, and lay aside that courteous and polite Behaviour which would so
well become their Birth. Yet what I here observe to you concerning the
young People is not so universally true as not to admit of great
Exceptions, which is the Case of every thing asserted in the general.</p>

<p>The Court is not without Ladies who are much to be valued. The Empress
Regent honours with her Confidence Madame the Countess <i>de Fuchs</i>, whose
Husband was Minister of State to the Emperor, and his Plenipotentiary at
<i>Hambourg</i>, where he died. This Countess is Sister to the Count <i>de</i>
<!--280.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span><i>Molard</i>,
Steward of the Emperor's Kitchens. She is a very polite Lady,
and is so far from being envy'd for being a Favourite that all Persons of
Distinction agree she deserves it, because she supports it with Modesty,
and makes no other Use of it but to do good.</p>

<p>Madamoiselle <i>de Klenck</i> has a very great share in the Favour of the
Empress Dowager, which I take to be a Reward due to her long Services, and
to her Merit. She is chief Maid of Honour to that Princess, and has been
engag'd to her ever since she has been at <i>Vienna</i>. If the Character of a
thorough Gentlewoman may be attributed to any of the Sex, Madamoiselle <i>de
Klenck</i> deserves it more than any other, it being impossible for a Person
to have more Integrity, and more Generosity.</p>

<p>The Countess Dowager of <i>Altheim</i>, of the <i>Pignatelli</i> Family, in regard
to whose Rank I ought to have mention'd her first, if I observ'd a very
strict Order in my Writings, is a Native of <i>Spain</i>. The Count <i>d'Altheim</i>
married her at <i>Barcelona</i>. Her Beauty was the more admir'd in <i>Spain</i>
because she was fair. This Lady has a noble Air, and has a Genius capable
for Affairs of the greatest Consequence. Their Imperial Majesties pay her
great Distinction, and all the Courtiers honour and respect her, so that
now in her Widowhood she continues in good Credit, and almost as much
Authority as she had when that great Favourite her Husband was living.</p>

<p>The Gentry of <i>Austria</i>, and of all the Emperor's Hereditary Dominions,
are so fond of the Title of Count, that the Gentlemen buy and sollicit it
as eagerly as if it was a great Estate. 'Tis well for them that the
Dispatch of their Patents does not cost much; for the greatest Privilege
which this brings them is all a Chimæra. These Counts may be said to hold
the same Rank among the ancient
Counts<!--281.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
of the Empire as the King's
Secretaries in <i>France</i> do among the Gentlemen of good Families.</p>

<p>As for Gentlemen, they are so common here that there are scarce any others
to be seen. All the Agents of the Court, and all the Referendaries procure
themselves a Title, tho' I know not why; for neither they nor their Wives
dare to rank themselves among the Prime Nobility. This Madness of theirs
to be enobled is so common, and so easy to be gratified, that I have known
a Man, who was formerly Messenger to the Emperor <i>Joseph</i>, purchase the
Title of Baron; and his Children begin to mix with the <i>Grand Monde</i>.</p>

<p>These, Sir, were all the Remarks that I made upon the <i>Austrians</i>. I must
give you a few Particulars concerning the Emperor's Person. I have already
said something to you of his Character: What follows is to shew you how
grateful he is, and how friendly, Virtues which are the more to be
esteem'd in him because they are not the most familiar to great Men.</p>

<p>The Emperor shows all possible Marks of Gratitude to those <i>Spaniards</i> who
adher'd to him while he was at <i>Barcelona</i>. He has loaded them with Wealth
and Honours; and if it's possible for one's native Country to be forgot,
he has put them in a Situation to forget theirs. This particular Goodness
of the Emperor extends to all that followed his Fortunes in <i>Spain</i>; whom
he distinguishes upon all Occasions, and does them good preferably to his
other Subjects. As to Friendship, no Monarch ever had more for any
Favourite than <i>Charles</i> had for the late Count <i>d'Altheim</i>, his Master of
the Horse. This Nobleman was the Emperor's Page, when he was only
Arch-Duke; and he attended that Prince to <i>Spain</i>, where his Care, his
Services, his Assiduity, and above all his Honesty and his Integrity, won
him the intire Confidence of the
young<!--282.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Monarch. When this Prince became
Emperor he rewarded the Count with Honours, Wealth, and Dignities. He
lov'd him as long as he liv'd, and his Memory is still dear to him. As
soon as he died, the Emperor declar'd himself Guardian to his Children,
gave Orders in what manner they shou'd be brought up, and now treats them
much more like his own Children than his Subjects. But what wou'd you say
of the Emperor's tender Love for the Empress? Some time ago this Princess
being dangerously ill, the Emperor not only sent for his Physicians, and
conjur'd them to employ all their Art to save her Life, but promised them
Rewards suitable to that Service, and actually watched with her several
Nights to see her take the Remedies they prescrib'd. Does not a
Conjugal-Love so perfect, deserve to be rewarded by the Birth of an
Archduke? Adieu, Sir. If I were Emperor, you shou'd be my Count
<i>d'Altheim</i>; but in the Condition I am in, you are the Person whom I
honour most of all Mankind; and am, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Munich, Jan. 5, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>As I came hither from <i>Vienna</i>, I stay'd two Days at <span class="smcap">Lintz</span>, the Capital of
<i>Upper Austria</i>. This City lies on the <i>Danube</i>, over which there is a
wooden Bridge. 'Tis a little Town, but well built, and has fine Churches.
Its Inhabitants are thriving, and they drive a great Trade in
Linnen-Cloth. 'Tis the Residence of a great many Persons of Quality, and
of the Regency of the Province, of which the Count <i>de Thirheim</i> is the
Chief. This Nobleman lodges in the Imperial Palace, which stands upon an
Eminence, and commands the City. The Building is commodious enough, but
not so magnificent. The Emperor <i>Leopold</i> stay'd here during the Siege of
<i>Vienna</i>; till not thinking himself safe in it he retir'd to <i>Passaw</i>. The
Neighbourhood of <i>Lintz</i> is very agreeable. All the way hither from
<i>Vienna</i> the <i>Danube</i> is lin'd on both sides with Vineyards; but from
<i>Lintz</i> to this Place, instead of Vines, there are Plantations of Hops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Munich</span>, in the <i>German</i> Tongue <i>Munchen</i>, stands in the middle of a large
Plain, and in the Center of <i>Bavaria</i>, of which it is the Capital City.
The Walls of it are washed by the River <i>Iser</i>; 'tis a small Town, but
better built than fortified, for within these few Years several fine
Houses have
been<!--284.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
rais'd in it. The Elector's Palace is one of the biggest
Piles of Building in <i>Europe</i>, but it wants a great deal of being so
handsome a Structure as <i>Misson</i> and several other Authors have
represented it; for its Magnificence consists principally in its Bulk. The
chief Front, which looks towards a very narrow Street, has the Resemblance
of a fair Convent; to which the Image of the Virgin <i>Mary</i> over the great
Gate contributes not a little. That for which 'tis held in most Esteem is
the great Apartment which is call'd the <i>Emperor's</i> Apartment. The
Connoisseurs in Painting admire the Pictures in the great Hall, which
represent both Sacred and Prophane History, and are performed by the Hand
of <i>Candi</i>. The Chimney-piece in the same Room is very much esteem'd:
Among other fine Figures with which it is adorn'd, there's a Statue of
Porphyry that represents <i>Virtue</i> holding a Spear in the Right Hand, and
in the Left a gilt Palm-Branch. In 1632, when <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> King of
<i>Sweden</i> made himself Master of <i>Munich</i>, he thought this so beautiful a
Room that he was sorry he could not get it transported to <i>Stockholm</i>. In
the Reign of <i>Ferdinand Mary</i>, Grandfather to the present Elector, great
part of the Palace of <i>Munich</i> was reduc'd to Ashes, which Accident was,
'tis said, the Occasion of that Prince's Death; for being at <i>Straubingen</i>
when he received the sad News of the Fire, he took Horse immediately and
rode with such Fury to <i>Munich</i> that he receiv'd a Fall which in a little
time prov'd his Death.</p>

<p>The present Elector <i>Charles-Albert-Cajetan</i> has embellish'd the Palace
with a new Apartment, which, tho' not so big as the Emperor's, exceeds it
in Magnificence. 'Tis adorn'd with noble Pictures, antique Busts, and
Vases plac'd upon<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Tables of
very<!--285.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
great Value; and among other Things
there's the Picture of the Virgin done by St. <i>Luke</i>.</p>

<p>There's a secret Passage from the Palace thro' little Galleries to all the
Churches and Convents in the Town. The nearest Church is that of the
<i>Theatins</i>, which together with their Monastery was built by
<i>Maria-Adelaide</i> of <i>Savoy</i> Wife to <i>Ferdinand-Mary</i>. The Fryars of this
Convent must be twenty seven in number, and all Men of Quality. They
subsist by charitable Donations; but dare not ask Alms, and must wait for
such Provisions as Providence shall please to send them. When they have
suffer'd extreme Want at any Time for three Days together, they are
permitted to ring a Bell as a Token of their Distress; but it has been
observ'd that this never happen'd above twice since their first
Establishment, because the Electors are too charitable to let them want.
The Tomb of the Princes of <i>Bavaria</i> is in the Church of these honest
Fryars.</p>

<p>The Church of our Lady is the parochial Church of <i>Munich</i>. In it is the
stately Tomb of the Emperor <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Bavaria</i> who died of Poison. 'Tis
adorn'd with a great many fine Figures of Brass and Marble. In this Church
the Elector on the 24th of <i>April</i> last instituted the Order of St.
<i>George</i>, by Authority of Pope <i>Benedict</i> XIII. The Ceremony was perform'd
with a vast deal of Pomp, and the Elector of <i>Cologn</i> officiated at the
High Mass. The Promotion consisted of three Grand Priors, six Grand
Crosses, a Commander, and six Knights. Some time after this first
Promotion the Elector made a second, in which he appointed one Grand
Cross, and nine Knights. 'Tis said there will speedily be a third
Promotion of eight more Knights, the whole Number being to consist of
forty<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<!--286.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>The Elector intends to annex Commanderies to his Order. They who are
admitted into it must give Proofs of their Extraction from sixteen
Descents; and this is so strictly observ'd that his most Serene Electoral
Highness, as Grand Master of the Order, has renounc'd all Power of
granting any Dispensation from it. According to the Statutes of this Order
all the Knights are oblig'd to be Catholics, to defend the Faith and the
Church, to protect Widows and Orphans, and to practise all the Christian
Virtues. The Badge of the Order is a large Sky-blue Ribbon border'd about
the breadth of an Inch with a black and white Stripe; and at the end of
the Ribbon hangs a Cross enamell'd with blue, in the middle of which there
is a St. <i>George</i>.</p>

<p>The Church and Convent of the Reverend Fathers the Jesuits are two very
magnificent Structures. The Roof of the Church which is one single Nave is
a Work of Skill and Ingenuity, wherein the Apertures are contriv'd with
very great Art; for which reason, the Curious look upon this Fabric as a
Master-piece of Architecture.</p>

<p>The Church of the Reverend Fathers of St. <i>Austin</i>, tho' but of a moderate
Size, contains Beauties that are not always to be met with in greater
Fabrics. The Pictures with which it is adorn'd are highly esteem'd, and
good Judges agree there are few that can parallel them.</p>

<p>Tho' the Houses of <i>Munich</i> are all very well built, there are few that
can be call'd Hotels or Palaces. The Count <i>Piosas</i> a <i>Piedmontese</i> has
caus'd one to be built of late Years which is a considerable Structure
with regard to the true Proportions of its Outside, and to the ingenious
Distribution of the Apartments, which have fine Decorations and good
Furniture.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>Bavaria</i> observes most of the Customs of the Court of
<i>Vienna</i> in matters of
Ceremony,<!--287.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
but as for the rest, their Way of living
is different; here being more Freedom, and more Diversion.</p>

<p>The Elector <i>Charles-Albert</i> delights in Pleasures and bodily Exercise,
and acquits himself therein with a Grace. He is a comely Personage, and
has a grave, noble, and majestic Air, so that he is taken for a proud Man;
yet few Princes are more gracious and more civil to Strangers, and to his
Subjects also he is easy of Access. He was full of Life and Spirit when he
was a Prince, and now that he is a Sovereign is become sedate and
moderate. He is genteel, talks <i>French</i>, <i>Italian</i>, and <i>Latin</i> well, is
Master of History, and perfectly acquainted with the Interest of Princes
in general, and that of his own Family in particular. He sticks to
Business, and above all seems to be very earnest in redressing his
Finances which he found in great Disorder when he acceded to the
Electorate. The Elector was born the 6th of <i>August</i>, 1697. He is Son of
<i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i> famous for his Victories and for his Disgrace, and of
<i>Theresa-Cunegunda-Sobieski</i>, Daughter of <i>John Sobieski</i> King of
<i>Poland</i>. When <i>Charles</i> came into the World he had a Brother living who
was born of the Arch-Duchess <i>Mary-Maximilian</i>, <i>Emanuel</i>'s first Wife.
This young Prince who all <i>Europe</i> expected wou'd be the Successor of
<i>Charles</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>, dying at <i>Brussels</i> the 6th of <i>February</i>,
1699, <i>Charles</i> thereby became the Electoral Prince: He was bred up at
<i>Munich</i> with four of his Brothers, but both he and his Brothers
surrender'd Prisoners to the Emperor <i>Joseph</i> after the Battle of
<i>Hochstet</i>, which subjected all <i>Bavaria</i> to his Imperial Majesty. That
Monarch had the young Princes remov'd to <i>Gratz</i>, where he caus'd them to
be treated in a manner not so suitable to their high Birth as to their
decay'd Fortune. When <i>Joseph</i> died, his Successor <i>Charles</i> VI. used the
Princes<!--288.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
with less Severity, caus'd them to be honourably attended, and
sent them Masters to instruct them; and upon the Peace of <i>Rastadt</i> which
reinstated the Elector <i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i> in his Dominions, the Princes
his Children were restor'd to him. They finish'd their Studies at
<i>Munich</i>, after which the Elector sent the four eldest to <i>Rome</i>, where
the second, whose Name was Duke <i>Philip</i>, died not long after he had been
chose Bishop of <i>Munster</i> and <i>Paderborn</i>. <i>Charles</i> returning from
<i>Italy</i> went to <i>Vienna</i>, made the Campaign of <i>Belgrade</i>, and some Years
after that, he marry'd <i>Mary-Amelia-Anne</i> of <i>Austria</i>, the late Emperor
<i>Joseph</i>'s second Daughter. In 1725, <i>Charles</i> and his three Brothers were
at <i>Fontainbleau</i>, at the Marriage of <i>Lewis</i> XV. and next Year he
succeeded his Father who died at <i>Munich</i> lamented as he was ador'd by his
Courtiers.</p>

<p>The Electoress who is a little Woman, very much resembles the Empress her
Mother, and has more Vivacity than is common to the Princes of the House
of <i>Austria</i>. She prefers Hunting to all other Pleasures, and there are
few Days but she partakes of that Diversion with the Elector, who, as well
as the Princes his Brothers, is fond of it.</p>

<p>The Elector has by his Marriage two<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Princes and two Princesses. The
eldest of the Sons who has the Title of the Electoral Prince is call'd
<i>Maximilian-Joseph</i>, and was born the 28th of <i>March</i>, 1727. His most
serene Electoral Highness's three Brothers are Duke <i>Ferdinand</i>, the
Elector of <i>Cologn</i>, and the Bishop of <i>Freisingen</i> and <i>Ratisbon</i>. Of
these Princes Duke <i>Ferdinand</i> is the only one who resides at <i>Munich</i>.
His most serene Highness is a Lieutenant-General, and has a Regiment of
Cuirassiers in the Emperor's Service. He is also a Knight of the <i>Golden
Fleece</i>, and Grand Prior of the Order of St. <i>George</i>. He marry'd
<i>Mary-Ann-Caroline</i>
of<!--289.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
<i>Newbourg</i>, by whom he has two Sons and one
Daughter. I have already told you that he was educated with the Elector
his Brother, with whom he made the Campaign of <i>Belgrade</i>, travell'd
several times to <i>Italy</i>, and last of all to <i>France</i>, where those Princes
were admir'd for their Splendor, their Politeness, their good Taste, and
their fine Understanding. One shan't find a Man more affable than Duke
<i>Ferdinand</i> who is even ador'd at <i>Munich</i>, and is dearly belov'd by the
Elector his Brother. The Duchess his Wife who is the best-natur'd Princess
in the World makes grand Entertainments, and is particularly civil to
Strangers.</p>

<p>The Bishop of <i>Freisingen</i> and <i>Ratisbon</i> spends more of his Time at
<i>Munich</i> than in his Diocese. He is a Prince of great Penetration, Spirit
and Vivacity, is generous, liberal, and charitable, extremely civil, and
'tis impossible to be acquainted with him without adding Love to that
Respect and Veneration which are due to his Birth and Character. He
enter'd very young into Orders, and was consecrated Bishop by his Brother
the Elector of <i>Cologn</i>. 'Twas thought at first that he wou'd have made
but an indifferent Ecclesiastic, but he has demonstrated that he knows how
to reconcile the Gravity of a Prelate with the Magnanimity of a Temporal
Prince.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>Bavaria</i> is without dispute the most gallant, and the
politest in <i>Germany</i>. We have a <i>French</i> Comedy here together with Balls
and Gaming every Day, and a Concert of Music three Times a Week, at which
all the Company is mask'd; and after the Concert there's Gaming and
Dancing. These public Assemblies, at which the Elector and the whole Court
are present, bring in a great Revenue to the Elector's <i>Valets de
Chambre</i>; for besides the Money which every one pays at Entrance, they are
also paid for the Cards, and
are<!--290.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
concern'd in almost all the Banks; so
that those Domestics have almost all the Cash of the Nobility, with whom
they don't scruple neither to rank themselves. Besides these noisy
Pleasures we have others that are more tranquil, I mean those of civil
Society. Of this kind there's more here than in the other Towns of
<i>Germany</i>; but more still among the Foreigners that are in the Elector's
Service than among the <i>Bavarians</i>; for these are generally proud, tho'
'tis certainly more owing to their Opinion that it gives them a good Air
to be so than to their Temper; and they actually become more sociable when
they are made sensible that their grand Airs are not astonishing.</p>

<p>The Title of Count is as common here as at <i>Vienna</i>, and the <i>Bavarian</i>
Counts have no greater Privileges than those of <i>Austria</i>, for they are as
much Subjects as the meanest Gentlemen. I find that those in Places, and
who bear any Rank at Court are much more polite than others. The Counts
<i>de Thirheim</i>, <i>Torring</i>, and <i>Preising</i> who have the chief Employments
are so civil that I believe there's few Foreigners but will give them
their Encomium.</p>

<p>The Elector has a very large Houshold, and a number of great Officers.
I'll mention some of them to you.</p>

<p>The Count <i>Maximilian de Torring-Seefeldt</i> is Steward of the Elector's
Houshold, a Minister of State, and Knight of the <i>Golden Fleece</i>. This
Nobleman who is advanc'd in Years, is good-natur'd and civil, speaks
little, is naturally grave, not fond of Pomp, and lives retir'd in the
middle of a Court, but when he makes any Entertainment does it with
Grandeur. He never once abandon'd the Elector <i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i> his
former Master, but follow'd him in his Fortunes both good and bad.</p>

<!--291.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>The Count <i>Sigismond de Thirheim</i> is Great Chamberlain, a Minister of
State, and Grand Croix of the Order of St. <i>George</i>. He is very tall, and
tho' his Air is not the most affable, he is courteous and civil. He lives
very nobly, and does the Honours of the Court very handsomely;
consequently he is generally beloved and esteem'd. He was Governor of the
Elector, who, contrary to most Princes that are not apt to retain an
Esteem for those who once had the Care of their Education, gives great
Proofs of his Regard for the Count <i>de Thirheim</i>.</p>

<p>The Count <i>Maximilian de Fugger</i> is Grand Marshal<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. As he does not
live at <i>Munich</i>, I have nothing particular to tell you of him.</p>

<p>The Count <i>Maximilian de Preysing</i> Master of the Horse, President of the
Chamber of Finances, a Minister of State, and Grand Croix of the Order of
St. <i>George</i>, is a very polite Nobleman, but serious and grave to the last
degree. 'Tis difficult for any Man to be more attach'd to his Religion, to
have more Candor, and to be more upright than this Minister. His Probity
has brought Envy upon him, but it has procur'd him the Elector's intire
Confidence, of which however the Count makes no farther Advantage than is
requisite for his Master's Business. He is accus'd of being close-fisted,
and of dissuading the Elector from giving Gratuities; but 'tis agreed that
he is very charitable to the Poor. 'Tis a hard matter for a Minister who
has the Direction of the Finances to please every body, and he is commonly
the Butt of public Censure.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Rechberg</i> Great Huntsman<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>, Minister of State, President
of the Council of War, Lieutenant-General, and Grand Croix of the Order of
St. <i>George</i>, is Commander in Chief of the
Elector's<!--292.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Forces: He
accompany'd the late Elector to <i>France</i> where he acquir'd the Reputation
of an experienc'd skilful General.</p>

<p><i>Ignatius-Joseph</i> Count <i>de Torring</i> is a Minister of State, Grand Master
of the Artillery, and a Grand Croix of St. <i>George</i>. He followed the late
Elector into <i>France</i>, and after that Prince was restor'd he went as
Minister Plenipotentiary to the Imperial Court, where he negotiated the
Marriage of the present Elector with the Archduchess, youngest Daughter to
the late Emperor <i>Joseph</i>.</p>

<p>I cou'd tell you of many other Persons of Distinction at the Court of
<i>Bavaria</i>, only I fear that being too particular wou'd tire your Patience.
The Ministers who bear the greatest Sway are the Counts <i>Maximilian de
Preysing</i> and <i>de Torring</i>, and M. <i>d'Unertel</i>. The first is Director of
the Finances; the second has the Province of Foreign Affairs; and the
third takes care of Affairs Domestic and Military. These three Ministers
are the Arbiters of <i>Bavaria</i>, and to them the Tribunals of the several
Provinces must apply.</p>

<p><i>Bavaria</i> is divided into four Cantons or Provinces, <i>viz.</i> the Cantons
<i>of Munich</i>, <i>Burghausen</i>, <i>Landstrut</i> and <i>Straubingen</i>. Each of these
Provinces has a Regency or Parliament; and an Appeal lies from Sentences
therein pass'd to the Elector's Council of State.</p>

<p>'Tis certain that <i>Bavaria</i> is one of the best States in the Empire. 'Tis
said that it brings in seven Millions of Florins, and I have been assured
by Persons who have Opportunities of being inform'd of the State of the
Finances, that there was a time when the late Elector received eleven
Millions <i>per Ann.</i> The Riches of <i>Bavaria</i> are owing to the Exportation
of Salt and Corn, and to the Consumption of the Beer brew'd in the
Country, which is as good as any in the World. <i>Tirol</i>, and the Country
<!--293.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>of
<i>Saltzbourg</i>, have almost all the Corn which they spend from
<i>Bavaria</i>, and the Elector has a Florin for every Sack that is exported.
Another thing which is a Treasure to <i>Bavaria</i> is the Fir-Trees, a Wood
that serves for every Use that can be imagin'd, whether for Building, or
for Houshold-Stuff. There is not a Province in the Empire where Provisions
are cheaper, and in the mean time there's a vast Home-Consumption; for
besides that the <i>Bavarians</i> love good Eating and Drinking, the Country is
very populous; and 'tis computed that the Inhabitants of <i>Munich</i> alone
are above 40,000.</p>

<p>Of all the Sovereigns in <i>Europe</i>, next to the King of <i>France</i>, the
Elector of <i>Bavaria</i> has the finest Pleasure-Houses, for which he may
thank the Elector his Father who had a wonderful good Fancy and Judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nymphenbourg</span> a short League from <i>Munich</i> is a charming Place. The Castle
is to be seen a great way off by reason of its Situation in the middle of
a great Plain, so that from the Apartments of the second Story one
discovers a vast Tract of Country, and an infinite number of Rural
Beauties that are in the Neighbourhood of <i>Munich</i>. <i>Mary-Adelaide de
Savoy</i> (Mother to <i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i>) who was extremely fond of the Arts
and Sciences, and knew them perfectly well, was the Person who laid the
Foundations of that Castle. The Man that she employ'd to build it was an
<i>Italian</i> Architect whom she sent for out of <i>Italy</i> for the purpose. But
all this Palace consisted only of one great Pavilion. <i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i>
thinking the Castle too small, caused several Mansions to be added to it,
together with fine Stables and grand Gardens; in short, he put the whole
into that magnificent Condition we see it in at this day. His most serene
Electoral Highness lets the Pavilion stand in pure respect to the Memory
of his Mother who built
it,<!--294.png--><span class="pagenum">269</span>
but 'tis pity he does; for 'tis much higher
than the rest of the Edifice, and is no good Ornament to the main
Building. In order to give you a more perfect Idea of this House, I will
tell you that it looks towards a great and magnificent Canal terminated at
each end by a spacious Basin adorn'd with Water-works and double Rows of
Trees on each side which form the Avenues. We enter into the Castle by an
Ascent of Marble Steps: The first Room we come to is a very great high
Salon adorn'd with Architecture of Plaister of <i>Paris</i> very well executed.
From each side of this Salon there is a Passage into several Apartments of
which I shall not stop to give you the Detail, because I don't think it in
my power to convey a suitable Idea to you of the Richness of the
Furniture, and all the fine things that are in it. Imagine only that the
late Elector who had an exquisite Taste, and a noble Soul, spar'd no Cost
to adorn these Apartments. I pass to the Gardens which one enters from the
Great Hall by a Descent of Marble Steps. The first thing that strikes the
Eye is a Parterre of a vast Extent, at the Entrance of which there is a
great Bason ornamented with a Group of Figures of mill'd Lead gilt with
Water-Gold representing <i>Flora</i> receiving Flowers from <i>Nymphs</i> and
<i>Cupids</i>. At the end of the Parterre there is one of the most agreeable
Woods in the World, which is cut by three Walks in form of a Goose's Foot.
The middlemost fronts the great Pavilion of the Castle, and has a large
Canal in the middle of it of which one can't see the end: 'Tis terminated
by a fine Cascade form'd by several Blocks of Marble, and adorn'd with
fine Statues. The second Walk on the right hand leads one to the Mall
which forms a Semi-Circle, and is one of the finest and longest I ever
saw. At the Entrance of this Mall there is a Pavilion call'd <i>Pagodebourg</i>
(the <i>Castle of the Pagode</i>;) 'tis two
Stories<!--295.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
high, and built in form of
the <i>Pagodes</i> Temples. I believe there never was any thing prettier. All
the Furniture of this little Palace is <i>Indian</i>, of a charming Contrivance
and Elegancy; and the whole is so well laid out that notwithstanding the
smallness of the House, the Elector has every Convenience in it that can
be desir'd. Over-against <i>Pagodebourg</i> on the other side of the Canal in
the third Walk is <i>Badenbourg</i> (the <i>Castle of Baths</i>) which is a more
considerable Building, and has all the Beauty of the Modern Bagnios. The
Baths are spacious and lin'd with Marble. There is an Apartment consisting
of several Pieces adorned with Stucco, and Pictures representing <i>Venus</i>
in the Bath, <i>Diana</i> in the Water with her Nymphs, and the other Subjects
of the Fable. The whole Apartment glitters with Gold, and the Furniture of
it is rich, and of a charming Fancy. This beautiful House is surrounded
with fine Pieces of Water adorned with Cascades and Statues. These Baths
wou'd most certainly deserve a particular Description, and I am angry with
myself for not being able to give it.</p>

<p>'Tis certain that next to the Gardens of <i>Versailles</i>, there is none so
magnificent as those of <i>Nymphenbourg</i>; which is a Place that Art and
Nature seem to have joined their Forces in order to render noble and
agreeable.</p>

<p>The Castle of <i>Schleisheim</i> is a more regular Building than that of
<i>Nymphenbourg</i>, and makes so grand an Appearance that I don't know any
House in <i>Germany</i> that can compare with it. The great Stair-Case and the
Salon in the large Apartment are the only Pieces in their kind. They are
fac'd with Marble, and painted in a most correct and beautiful manner.</p>

<p><i>Taco</i>, <i>Furstenriet</i> and <i>Starenberg</i> are Houses fit for the Solacement
of a Great Prince, and will
be<!--296.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Testimonies to Posterity of the Elector
<i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i>'s grand and happy Taste.</p>

<p>Of all the Elector's Houses <i>Nymphenbourg</i> is that where the Court resides
most. It is as well a Hunting-House as a Pleasure-House, by reason of a
Park in the Neighbourhood which is eight Leagues in compass, and cut out
into a great number of fine long Roads. Here the Elector comes to rouze
the Stag; and there is a little Park adjoining to the Gardens, which, as
well as the adjacent Fields, abounds with Pheasants, Partridges, and all
other Game of that sort.</p>

<p>When the Court is at <i>Nymphenbourg</i> the Electress has a Drawing-Room there
three times a Week where there is Gaming, and when that is over the Ladies
sup with their Electoral Highnesses, who sometimes admit Gentlemen of
their Court to their Table, but commonly all Foreigners. They who prefer
taking the Air to Gaming, find open Calashes every Evening drawn by two
Horses, at the bottom of the Steps on the side of the Garden: A Gentleman
drives the Calash, two Ladies ride in it, and a Gentleman stands behind.
And such as prefer the Water find very neat Gondolas finely gilt upon the
Canal at their Service; so that there is no want of any thing to add to
the Pleasures of all sorts in this inchanting Place.</p>

<p>Were I to enumerate to you all the various Pleasures of this Court I
should never have done. For the present I shall confine myself to these
already mentioned. I am resolved to set out in three or four days for
<i>Stutgard</i>. I shall lie at <i>Augsbourg</i>, and at <i>Ulm</i>. A Frost which has
held for a Month without ceasing has made the Roads so hard that I hope I
shall roll along finely. I expect to hear from you at <i>Stutgard</i>. Pray
take care that I be not disappointed, and believe that I am very
sincerely, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XV.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Stutgard, Jan. 14, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>There is nothing remarkable between <i>Munich</i> and <i>Augsbourg</i> except it be
the fine Abbey of <span class="smcap">Furstenfeldt</span>, which is in possession of the <i>Bernardin</i>
Fryars. It was founded by <i>Lewis the Severe</i> Duke of <i>Bavaria</i> to attone
for his Wickedness in putting <i>Joan</i> of <i>Brabant</i> his Wife unjustly to
death. The History of <i>Bavaria</i> relates the Fact thus: <i>Joan</i> was a very
beautiful Princess. Her Husband who was doatingly fond of her being
obliged to take a Journey, put her under the Guard of one of his Aunts.
While he was gone <i>Joan</i> wrote frequently to her Husband, and sometimes to
his Prime Minister and Favourite. One day she put her Letters into the
hands of a Domestic, charging him to deliver them as they were directed;
but the Man made a Mistake, and gave the Letter which was for the Duke to
his Favourite, and that which was for the Minister to the Duke. <i>Lewis</i>
thought that his Wife's Style was too obliging to a Subject, and was even
mad with Jealousy. He first kill'd his Favourite, and then taking horse
posted to <i>Donawert</i> where his Wife was. He came to the Castle in the
Night-time, murder'd the Porter with his own hand, put his Aunt and all
with whom he had left his Wife in charge to Death; and then like another
<i>Herod</i>, caused the unfortunate <i>Joan</i> to be beheaded. The Night after
this barbarous Action, the Heirs
of<!--298.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
<i>Lewis</i>'s Head turn'd gray, tho' he
was but twenty-eight Years old; which Accident made him sensible of his
Guilt and of the Innocence of his Wife. As his Barbarity was great, so was
his Repentance. He went on foot to <i>Rome</i> to beg the Pope's Absolution for
his Sins, and obtain'd it on condition that he wou'd cause a Church to be
built, and found a Monastery in his Dominions. <i>Lewis</i> returning from
<i>Rome</i> founded the Abbey at <i>Furstenfeldt</i>. The first Establishment was
only for eight Fryars; but the Piety of the Princes of <i>Bavaria</i> having
wrought upon them to bestow their Favours upon this House, it now
maintains thirty Fryars and an Abbot, whom the Monks have the Prerogative
to chuse out of their own Body. These good Fathers are actually erecting a
very stately Church, and they enjoy all the Conveniences of Life.</p>

<p>The Country between <i>Munich</i> and <i>Augsbourg</i> is level and intermix'd with
Woods and Plains. <span class="smcap">Augsbourg</span> which is a Bishop's See, and an Imperial City,
is the Capital of <i>Swabia</i>, and one of the biggest and handsomest Towns in
<i>Germany</i>. A small Branch of the <i>Leck</i> passes thro' it, and supplies it
with plenty of Water. The Streets of <i>Augsbourg</i> are broad, strait and
lightsome; the Houses well built, and many of 'em full of Paintings. The
Inhabitants look upon <i>Augustus</i> to be the Founder of their City. 'Tis
true that Emperor sent a Colony thither, but the Town was founded before.
It is not said what Name it went by before the Name of <i>Augusta
Vindelicorum</i> was given it to distinguish it from the other Towns that
bore the Name of <i>Augusta</i>. The clearing up of this difficulty is what I
shall leave to the Antiquarians, and confine my self to the Transactions
at <i>Augsbourg</i> for about two hundred Years past. What will render this
City for ever famous is the Confession of Faith which the Protestant
Princes presented here to the Emperor <i>Charles</i>
V.<!--299.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
in the year 1530. Tho'
the Protestants were at that time very powerful in <i>Augsbourg</i> they cou'd
not keep their ground, for they were drove out by the <i>Bavarians</i>; but
<i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> restored them in 1632, since which time they have kept
their Footing there, and share the Government with the Roman Catholics. In
1687, the Emperor, <i>Spain</i>, the United Provinces, and the Electors of
<i>Saxony</i>, <i>Brandenbourg</i>, and the Palatinate concluded that famous League
at <i>Augsbourg</i> against <i>Lewis</i> XIV. who was beginning to inforce the Claim
of the Duchess of <i>Orleans</i> his Sister-in-law to the Succession of the
Elector Palatine <i>Charles-Lewis</i>, who was that Princess's Brother. In
1690, <i>Joseph</i> Archduke of <i>Austria</i> King of <i>Hungary</i>, the eldest Son of
the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>, was consecrated and crown'd King of the <i>Romans</i> at
<i>Augsbourg</i>, at which Ceremony the Emperor, the Empress, the Electors of
<i>Mentz</i>, <i>Cologn</i>, <i>Triers</i>, <i>Bavaria</i>, and the Palatinate were personally
present.</p>

<p>In 1703, the Elector <i>Maximilian</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>, made himself Master of
<i>Augsbourg</i> in one Week's time. This City had demanded and obtained a
Neutrality, but having afterwards received an Imperial Garrison the
Elector made use of that Pretence to lay Siege to it. He caused the
Fortifications to be demolish'd, foreseeing, no doubt, that he should not
be able to keep the Place. <i>Augsbourg</i> was set free again by the Battle of
<i>Hochstet</i>, and still enjoys its Freedom under its own Magistrates, the
Bishop having no Authority in the City as to Temporals. The present Bishop
is of the Family of <i>Neubourg</i>, and Brother to the Elector Palatine. This
Prince has the same Goodness of Temper which is so natural to all his
Family. As his Bishoprick is not one of the most considerable in
<i>Germany</i>, so his Court is none of the biggest,
but<!--300.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
his Houshold is well
regulated, and every thing conducted in it with Order and Splendor.</p>

<p>The Chapter of the Cathedral consists of Persons of Quality who are
oblig'd to make Proof of their Nobility. The Canons have the Prerogative
of chusing their Bishop, who like all the Prelates of <i>Germany</i> is a
Sovereign Prince. He dwells at <i>Augsbourg</i>, tho' he ought to reside at
<i>Dillingen</i>. The Episcopal Palace is old, and not very commodious: It
joins to the Cathedral, which is a <i>Gothic</i> gloomy unwieldy Fabric, but
its Ornaments are very rich.</p>

<p>The most considerable Building is the Town-house, a very substantial Pile
built all of Freestone except the Portico, which is of Marble. The Rooms
are very fine, and the great Hall especially is to the last degree
magnificent. The Walls are cover'd with Painting, being such Emblems and
Devices as have relation to the Government. Nothing can be more beautiful
than the Cieling which consists all of Compartments whose Frames are
carv'd and gilt in an extraordinary manner, the whole enrich'd with
Pictures and other Ornaments perfectly well dispos'd.</p>

<p>Before the Town-house there's a very stately Fountain, where, among other
fine Figures of Brass, the Statue of <i>Augustus</i> which is represented in a
most noble Attitude is highly esteem'd.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Augsbourg</i> is in my Opinion something like <i>Antwerp</i> with
regard to the Spaciousness of the Streets and the Substantialness of its
Buildings; and formerly when the <i>Venetians</i> were Masters of all the
Commerce, it resembled it in Trade; for <i>Augsbourg</i> was then the Staple
for Merchandize, which was from thence transported to a great part of
<i>Europe</i>. But since <i>London</i> and <i>Amsterdam</i> are become the Warehouses of
the whole World, and the Commerce of <i>Venice</i> decays, the greatest Trade
of <i>Augsbourg</i> consists in Goldsmith's Wares, with which this City
furnishes <i>Germany</i>, <i>Poland</i>, and in
general<!--301.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
almost all the North. These
Wares are much cheaper here than elsewhere, and when the Patterns are
furnish'd People are well serv'd. Notwithstanding the Decay of its
Commerce there are several very rich Families; but whether any can do what
<i>Fugger</i> did to the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. is a Question. That Monarch
passing thro' <i>Augsbourg</i> lodg'd at <i>Fugger</i>'s House, who entertain'd him
like an Emperor. The Fewel he burnt in every Chimney was Cedar, and after
the Repast, which was extraordinary sumptuous, <i>Fugger</i> took a Bond for a
very considerable Sum which the Emperor ow'd him, and threw it into the
Fire.</p>

<p>The Nobility assemble commonly every Evening at the <i>Three Kings</i> Inn
where I quarter. There's a very fine Hall well lighted, where they game,
club for a Supper, and after Supper dance. Be not scandaliz'd that the
Nobility have their Assembly at an Inn, it being one of the best Houses in
<i>Germany</i> and the most superb Inn in <i>Europe</i>. There's very good
Attendance. I have supp'd at it twice, and one cannot be better
accommodated in any House whatsoever.</p>

<p>From <i>Augsbourg</i> I came to <span class="smcap">Ulm</span> another Imperial City. Tho' all the Country
is even, yet 'tis very tiresome to Travellers because of the Pavement of
the Causeys; but Thanks to the Snow which has levell'd the Ways, I have
not been much incommoded; tho' on the other hand I had like to have been
lost in the Snow, such a quantity of it having fallen for two Days that
one could not distinguish the Roads. I found my self at a Post-Stage where
my Guide, tho' he was a Man that had grown grey in the Business of
Postilion upon the same Road, did not know the Way. I was in danger every
Moment of tumbling into some Ditch, when just as we entered a certain
Valley my Postilion sounded a Horn to give notice to
any<!--302.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Carriages or
Horses that might happen to meet us to make way, when a Voice from the
Hollow call'd out to the Postilion, <i>Who's that? Stephen? Oh!</i> cry'd the
Postilion, <i>Is it you, Christopher? God be thank'd that I met with you</i>!
Then turning towards me, he said with an Air of Satisfaction, <i>Now you are
out of all Danger, for here's a blind Man that will conduct us to the
Place we are going to</i>. I thought the Droll jok'd with me, but we had not
gone many Yards farther before I really saw a poor Wretch who could not
see, yet offer'd to be my Guide, and promis'd he wou'd conduct me very
well. I abandon'd my self to him, and he walk'd so fast before my Chaise
that the Horses follow'd him in a gentle Trot till we came safe to the
Stage. There he told me that 'twas fifteen Years ago that he lost his
Sight by the breaking of an Imposthume in his Eyes, after having suffer'd
such horrible Pains for two Months that he bless'd himself for the Loss of
his Sight; so that when I ask'd him if he was not very much concern'd at
it, he said that at first it made him melancholy for some time, but that
he always comforted himself by the Remembrance of the Torture he had
undergone in the Loss of his Sight, and that he thought it were much
better to be blind and to have his Health than to see, and suffer the
Pains that he had endur'd; but that now he was so us'd to his Condition it
gave him no Concern. Indeed, when I ask'd him, if he should not be very
glad to recover his Sight? he said, Yes, if it were possible; but that if
he must undergo the same Pains to recover it as he had felt in the Loss of
it, he had rather by a thousand times continue blind. When I told him of
my Surprize that he should find out the Way better than those who see, he
told me that since he had been blind he came regularly on Sundays and
Saints Days to the Place where we were to hear Mass, and that therefore
the
Road<!--303.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
was become very familiar to him. He added, that he sometimes
went alone to beg three or four Leagues from his Village, which was a
quarter of a League from the hollow Way where I met with him. I sent the
Man away, after giving him some Relief; and could not but admire the
divine Providence, which tho' it had afflicted the poor Wretch with what
to me seems more terrible than Death, gave him Strength to bear his
Misfortune with Patience.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Ulm</i> is not above half as big as <i>Augsbourg</i>, but is much
better fortify'd. The <i>Danube</i> which washes its Walls, becomes navigable
at this Place, and a Boat goes from hence every Week for <i>Vienna</i>, which
is a great Ease to People who are not in a Condition to lay out much
Money; for it costs but a <i>Creutzer</i>, which is one Penny a <i>German</i> Mile.
Tho' the City of <i>Ulm</i> maintains a very numerous Garison, and is very well
fortify'd, and furnished with a good Arsenal, the Elector <i>Maximilian</i> of
<i>Bavaria</i> took it by Surprize in 1702, it being a Place necessary for him
to secure his Dominions on that side, and to facilitate the Passage of the
<i>French</i> Troops that were to join his Army. General <i>Thungen</i> robb'd him
of this Conquest the 10th of <i>Sept.</i> 1704, after about a Week's Siege.</p>

<p>Then it was that <i>Ulm</i> became again subject to its Magistrates who are all
<i>Lutherans</i>. The Catholics cannot enjoy Offices, but have several
Churches. This City drives a great Trade in Linnen, but few of the Gentry
live here except the Patricians who are not more sociable than those of
<i>Nuremberg</i> and <i>Augsbourg</i>. The Burghers and the Women in particular go
dress'd like those at <i>Augsbourg</i>. To see them go to and come from Church
is next kin to seeing a Masquerade, and 'tis certainly one of the most
diverting Sights in this City, where really I did not give my self time to
be tired, for I set
out<!--304.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
again the very next Day after I came, and arrived
in this Town, where I have now rested my self a couple of Days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stutgard</span> lies in the middle of a Valley surrounded with Vineyards. 'Tis
pretty large, has Streets broad and strait, but the Houses are of Timber.
'Tis the Capital of the Duchy of <i>Wirtemberg</i>, and was formerly the
Residence of the Sovereigns of the Country; but <i>Eberhard-Lewis</i> the
present Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i> established his Seat some Years ago at<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
<i>Ludwigsbourg</i>, a new City and a new Palace of his own building.</p>

<p>The Duke's Castle is an old Structure of Freestone, compos'd of four Piles
of Building, flank'd at each Angle by a Tower. The Walls of it are wash'd
by Ditches which give it the disagreeable Air of a Prison. The Duchess who
is the Duke's Wife, and Sister to the Margrave of <i>Baden-Dourlach</i>, has an
Apartment in this Palace. You know that this Princess and her Husband
don't live well together. The Prince<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> about twenty Years ago preferr'd
a Mistress to her<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, who certainly has neither the Beauty, nor the
Merit of the Duchess. The Princess is remarkably patient under the
Indifference of a Husband, and the Contempt of the most haughty Rival that
ever was. The frequent Visits paid her by her only Son are all the Comfort
she has. The Court neglects her, no body
dares<!--305.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
to go near her, and
whoever pays the Duchess the Respects that are naturally due to her, is
sure to incur the merciless Hatred of the Mistress. I may be able perhaps
to give you a farther Account of this Princess and her Rival when I have
been at <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>, whither I propose to go to-morrow, and where I
hope for a Line from you.</p>

<h2>LETTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Ludwigsbourg, Feb. 2, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>The Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i> is a Prince of a middling Size, and before he
grew so fat was very well shap'd. He is genteel, affable, and
well-belov'd, and few Princes treat their Courtiers with more Familiarity.
He has been one of the best Dancers of his Time. He also sits perfectly
well on horseback, and performs all bodily Exercises with infinite
Gracefulness, and incomparable Dexterity. He takes pleasure sometimes in
driving his own Coaches, and I have seen him drive eight Horses without a
Postilion, and manage them with as much Ease as if there was but one Horse
in the Harness. He is a Prince that loves Magnificence, is generous,
gallant, and amorous. Tho' 'tis above twenty Years that he has kept one
and the same Mistress, he is as passionately fond of her, and gives as
shining Proofs of it as ever. During the last War his most Serene Highness
commanded the army of the Empire on the <i>Upper Rhine</i>. He
has<!--306.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
an only Son
marry'd to <i>Henrietta</i> of <i>Prussia</i>, Daughter of the Margrave <i>Philip</i>,
Brother to <i>Frederic</i> I. King of <i>Prussia</i>. This young Prince is called
the hereditary Prince. He is short of Stature, but handsome. He has one of
the best Tempers that can be desir'd in a Sovereign, being humane,
good-natur'd, affable, and civil. It may be said that the Father and the
Son are the two politest Men at the Court of <i>Wirtemberg</i>. The Father has
spent several Years in <i>Holland</i>, <i>Lorrain</i>, <i>Geneva</i>, <i>Turin</i>, <i>Italy</i>
and <i>France</i>. When he return'd from his Travels he went and marry'd at
<i>Berlin</i>. He has an only Daughter who is very amiable. The hereditary
Prince is vastly fond of Grandeur, Dancing, Plays and Music: He fatigues
himself very much, and commonly rides seven or eight Horses in a Morning.
His tender Constitution and the little Care he takes of it make me
apprehensive he will not live to be an old Man<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<p>The hereditary Princess has an Air of Grandeur and Majesty suitable to her
Rank. She is tall and handsome, has a noble Mien, and tho' she is not a
regular Beauty, 'tis certain that she has a very good Look. She is
extremely grave, and does not seem to take a great share in the Pleasures
of the Court. She seems to be most of all taken with Dress, and her
Apparel is not only splendid but well-fancy'd. Her Royal Highness, which
is a Title given her because she is the Daughter of a King's Brother, is
extremely gracious and civil to all Mankind, but particularly to those
whom she knew at the Court of <i>Prussia</i>. She does me the honour to
discourse with me sometimes. I find she thinks very justly, and that her
Sentiments are very agreeable to her Birth. This Princess is of the
<i>Calvinist</i> Religion, and she keeps a Chaplain who preaches to her in her
own Apartment; so that now while the
Prince<!--307.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
<i>Alexander de Wirtemberg</i> is
here, there are three Chapels in the Castles of as many different

<p>The Countess <i>de Wurben</i> is the first Lady at Court next to her Royal
Highness. She has been the Duke's sole Favourite for a long time. She is
<i>Gravenitz</i> by Name, and is descended of a noble Family in <i>Mecklembourg</i>.
The Duke first fell in love with her when she was but a Girl. She had the
Assurance after she had been some Years in Favour to insist that the Duke
should get a Divorce from the Duchess his Wife, by whom he had a Son, and
marry her. When the Duchess was inform'd of her Rival's Demand she sued
for the Emperor's Protection, and obtain'd it. That Monarch signified to
the Duke that he would do well to remove his Favourite, who was therefore
oblig'd to retire to <i>Swisserland</i>. The Duke who could not bear her out of
his sight, followed her thither and stay'd there with her for some time,
but at last being oblig'd to return to his Dominions, and not being able
to take Madamoiselle <i>de Gravenitz</i> to him without reviving the just
Suspicions of the Duchess, he look'd out for a Husband for his Mistress.
The Count <i>de Wurben</i> a Gentleman of a good Family, and in mean
Circumstances, but a very eager Stickler for the Favours of Fortune at any
rate whatsoever, made an offer to marry Madamoiselle <i>de Gravenitz</i>. She
was bestowed upon him with a Pension of 24000 Florins, and the Character
of the Duke's Envoy Extraordinary to the Imperial Court. He engag'd never
to make use of the Husband's Prerogative and never to require of his Wife
to leave the Court. Upon this Condition he obtain'd even before he set out
for <i>Vienna</i> the Office of <i>Landthoffmeister</i> or Lord Lieutenant of
<i>Wirtemberg</i>, which is the highest Dignity in the Country. When the
Marriage was concluded, Madam <i>de Wurben</i> returned to <i>Stutgard</i>, where
she<!--308.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
had Lodgings in the Palace. All her Aim was to insult the Duchess, in
hopes of provoking her to commit something so outragious as might embroil
her with the Duke, and make him resolve never to forgive her; but this
Princess equally virtuous and prudent, and always patient, bore all this
Mortification without murmuring. The Mistress, who could not endure to see
her in the Palace, obtain'd an Order from the Duke for her Retirement to
the Estate which was settled on her for her Jointure; but the Duchess
would never comply to it, saying, that if she had not been unfortunate
enough in the Loss of her Husband she would not retire to her Jointure.
This Refusal, how reasonable soever it was, affronted the Duke, who
acquainted the Duchess that he did not look upon her any longer as his
Wife, and gave orders that she should be treated no longer as a Sovereign.
During this, Madam <i>de Wurben</i> became a Widow; whereupon all the Hopes
reviv'd that she had presumed to entertain when a Maid. She persuaded the
Duke to leave <i>Stutgard</i>, and to found <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>. As soon as this
House was in a Condition to be occupy'd, the Duke and his Mistress came
and liv'd in it. There's no sort of Intrigue which this Favourite has not
try'd to put herself in the Duchess's Rank, but hitherto she has not been
able to succeed. Mean-while she enjoys all the Honours of a Sovereign.
'Tis at her Apartments that the Court is kept. Whenever the Duke plays
'tis there, and there it is he diets. In short she is treated in every
thing upon a par with her Royal Highness. Her Excellency (which is the
only Title given to this imperious Favourite since the Death of her
Husband) is drawing on to fifty Years of Age, and yet carries a mighty
Sway. She employs all the Remedies imaginable to cancel the Injuries which
Time has done to her Complexion, and also to conceal her natural Temper;
for
Artifice<!--309.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
and Dissimulation are the Compounds of her Character. She is
so eager in amassing of Riches that she makes it her chief Business. While
she pretends a mighty Respect for the Duke, she expects like another
<i>Astarte</i> that every Knee should bend and tremble before her. As she is
the Reservoir of Favour, greater Court is made to her than to the Duke
himself, and Woe be to those that dare to disoblige her! I must own
however that she knows how to behave as well as any Woman in <i>Germany</i>,
when she has a mind to shew her Politeness. The worst on't is, that she is
not always so inclin'd; for she has been so long us'd to give herself
great Airs that they are become habitual to her. The principal Offices of
the Court are distributed among her Kindred or Creatures. Her Brother the
Count <i>de Gravenitz</i> is Grand Marshal and Prime Minister. I hardly ever
saw a handsomer Man: I must also do him the justice to declare that he is
as civil as his Sister is haughty. Some Years ago the Duke obtain'd for
him the Dignity of a Count of the Empire, in which Quality he was admitted
also at the Dyet, and he has a Seat there on the Bench of the Counts of
<i>Swabia</i>. His Authority is never oppos'd but by his Sister, to whom he
will not always be obedient. 'Tis said their Divisions have sometimes gone
so far that the Favourite has done all in her power to turn out her
Brother, and he has try'd all Ways in his turn to remove his Sister, but
the Duke has always been so good as to reconcile them. The Prime Minister
and his eldest Son are honour'd with the Order of <i>Prussia</i>. There is no
Court in <i>Europe</i> where there's such a Variety of Orders and Ribbons. The
Duke bears alternatively the <i>Danish</i> Order of the <i>Elephant</i>, the
<i>Prussian</i> Order of the <i>Black Eagle</i>, and his own Order which is that of
St. <i>Hubert</i>.</p>

<!--310.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince has the Order of <i>Prussia</i> and that of the Duke his
Father.</p>

<p>The Prince <i>Charles-Alexander</i> wears the <i>Fleece</i>, and the Order of
<i>Wirtemberg</i><a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. Prince <i>Lewis</i> his Brother wears the <i>Polish</i> Order of
the <i>White Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Schunck</i> heretofore the Duke's Minister of State, and at
present Great Bailiff of a Bailywic, is Knight of the Order of
<i>Dannebrog</i>.</p>

<p>I should never have done were I to give you the Names of all the Knights
of the Order of St. <i>Hubert</i>, and the many petty Sovereigns that have been
the Grand Masters.</p>

<p>The Duke's particular or Cabinet-Council is compos'd of the Hereditary
Prince and the Counts <i>de Gravenitz</i>, Father and Son, the Baron <i>de
Schutz</i>, and M. <i>de Pollnitz</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. There are many other Counsellors of
State, but not being admitted to the Cabinet-Council they are not in so
much Esteem as the others.</p>

<p>His most Serene Highness keeps the Estimate of his Forces to himself. I
think that he has now 4000 Men without reckoning his Life-Guards, which
are two Companies, the finest of all the Guards in <i>Germany</i>. One of these
Companies is commanded by the Lieutenant-General Baron <i>de Phul</i>, and the
other by a Count of <i>Witgenstein</i>. They are dress'd in yellow, and are
only distinguish'd by the Facing of their Clothes and their Bandeliers,
<!--311.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>one
of which is Black and the other Red. Their Regimental Clothes are
Yellow with Silver Lace. The Duke has also a Company of Cadets on
Horseback, all Gentlemen. They are dress'd in Red, with black Velvet
Facings and Silver Lace. They mount Guard at the Duke's Apartment only.
Two of them always stand Centry before his Highness's Chamber-Door.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>Wirtemberg</i> is one of the most numerous in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>There's a Grand Marshal, who as I have told you is the Count <i>de
Gravenitz</i>, Brother to the Favourite.</p>

<p>A Marshal of the Court, who is second Son to the Grand Marshal.</p>

<p>A Travelling Marshal, who is Brother-in-law to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>A Great Cup-bearer, who is the Baron <i>de Frakenberg</i>.</p>

<p>A Master of the Horse.</p>

<p>A Great Huntsman.</p>

<p>Four Chamberlains.</p>

<p>A Number of Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, and Gentlemen of the Court.</p>

<p>Two Captains of the Guards.</p>

<p>A considerable number of Counsellors of State and Aulic Counsellors.</p>

<p>Twenty Pages, all Men of good Families.</p>

<p>And finally a great many Footmen, and Officers of the Kitchen, Pantry, and
Buttery.</p>

<p>The Duke's Stables are the best furnish'd of any in <i>Europe</i>. One shall
not see finer Horses, or any that are better manag'd. The Hunting Equipage
is also very magnificent; and I don't know one thing that is wanting. His
Highness keeps a Company of <i>French</i> Comedians to whose Performance every
body is admitted <i>gratis</i>. We have often Balls, Masquerades, and Concerts
of Music.
There<!--312.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
is an Assembly at the Favourite's House every day, where
the Company plays at Piquet, Quadrille, and Pharo; so that here are all
the Pleasures of a great Court. The Duke's Table is serv'd with very great
Cost and Delicacy, and is commonly spread for sixteen Guests. The Duke
sits at the upper end, between her Royal Highness and her Excellency. The
Gentlemen are plac'd according to the Rank which they derive from their
Employments, and the Ladies according to the Offices which are borne by
their Husbands.</p>

<p>There's a Ceremonial observ'd here which is not known in any other Court,
<i>viz.</i> the Duke's Ministers give place to no Foreigner, unless he be a
Minister like themselves to some Prince, or unless he be a Count of the
Empire. These have so distinguish'd a Rank at this Court that all who are
not Counts must give place to them. A Count of the Empire, tho' he be a
Cadet in the hundredth Generation, a Lieutenant or an Ensign, as it
sometimes happens, in the Duke's Service, takes place of all Ministers and
great Officers who are not Counts. This is a Regulation which her
Excellency made after her Brother was created a Count, to the end that her
Family might have the more Honour, and that the greater Respect might be
paid to her own Dignity of Countess without a County.</p>

<p>I have told you that the Duke had transferr'd his Residence from
<i>Stutgard</i> to <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>, and the reason which made him abandon the
Capital of his Dominions; but why he preferr'd the Situation of his new
Town to a hundred others that he might have chose more agreeable, is what
I cannot account for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludwigsbourg</span> is remote from any River, great Roads and Forests. The Duke
at first only built a small Mansion-House with two advanced Wings, so
disposed that the Court lay between the House and the Garden; but he has
since made great
Additions<!--313.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
to it, and is actually building a large
Mansion between the Court and the Garden, to which the Wings of the former
Building are to be joined. One <i>Frisoni</i>, an <i>Italian</i>, has the direction
of these Works; in which it appears that he is a much better Mason than an
Architect. The new Building runs so far out that it discovers all the
Effects of it. The Front of the Mansion consists of three Stories,
including the Ground-Floor; but on the Garden side there are only two of a
moderate Height, so that one wou'd take this Building rather for an
Orangerie than for the Palace of a Sovereign. The great Stair-Case is
dark, the Apartments want Light, the Chambers are long and narrow, and
have very few Outlets. However, this single Building was undertaken by
<i>Frisoni</i> for 700000 Florins, exclusive of several sorts of Materials with
which he was furnished.</p>

<p>The old Mansion, which fronts the new, is not near so large, tho' it is
three Stories high every way. The Apartments are small and too
inconvenient to live in, yet no Cost has been spar'd to adorn them;
Carving, Gilding, and Painting being employ'd in them with more Profusion
than Judgment. The Furniture is rich, but of a very odd Fancy. The best
thing in all the Palace is the Chapel, which would every where be reckon'd
a fine noble Structure. But notwithstanding all the Faults which are
observ'd in the Palace, it must be allow'd that whoever lives to see it
finish'd will find it a magnificent Piece of Work. In the Gardens there
are several Terrasses, which rising by degrees one above another, intirely
bound the Prospect of the Palace. 'Tis certain that when the Duke's
Architects saw this Prince resolutely determin'd to build at
<i>Ludwigsbourg</i>, they ought at least to have advis'd him to place his
Palace at the very spot where his Gardens end: In this case it would have
stood in the middle of a Plain, the Apartments would not have been cramp'd
by
the<!--314.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Buttresses, with which the Palace is encompass'd, and the Gardens
wou'd have had a gentle Descent; and for a very little Expence there might
have been a fine Piece of Water at one end, betwixt them and a Coppice,
which is a Walk for Pheasants.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Ludwigsbourg</i> is as irregular as the Palace; and its
Scituation, which is very disadvantageous, will always render it a very
incommodious Town, because of the unevenness of the Ground. Most of the
Houses are of Timber, and slightly built; for those who build them do it
with an Ill-will, either out of Necessity, or to please the Duke who seems
to be fond of building. This Prince has ruin'd <i>Stutgard</i>, and will never
make a good Town of <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>; for if the Court was absent from it
but one Year, 'twou'd be one of the meanest Villages in <i>Wirtemberg</i>. This
Town is in no respect very agreeable. The Nobility here don't seem very
fond of Strangers, and there are no Entertainments but what are made by
the Duke. No body here, not even the Prime Minister keeps a Table; and all
the Expence of the Courtiers is in their Dress, and their Horses. Yet
there is not a Prince of the Empire who gives handsomer Salaries, except
the Electors; so that the Case is the very reverse here to what it is at
almost all other Courts, for here People grow rich, whereas elsewhere they
are beggar'd. I have known Persons that came to this Court in mean
Circumstances, and in a few Years got Estates. The Duke is by nature
generous and beneficent, and wou'd be more so if his Liberality was not
curb'd. He has given several Gentlemen Materials for building <i>gratis</i>;
and the Houses were no sooner up but he purchas'd them, and paid as dear
for 'em as if he had not contributed a Shilling towards raising them. I
have been assur'd that his most Serene Highness's Revenues amounted to
four Millions of Florins. 'Tis certain that he
is<!--315.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Master of one of the
finest Countries in all <i>Germany</i>; a Country which has plenty of every
thing, but Money is scarce by reason of the Fertility of the neighbouring
Provinces, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Palatinate</i>, <i>Bavaria</i>, <i>Franconia</i>, and <i>Alsace</i>.
The People are desirous of a War upon the Upper <i>Rhine</i>, in hopes of
putting off their Commodities.</p>

<p>The <i>Lutheran</i> is the only Religion tolerated in the Duchy of
<i>Wirtemberg</i>, tho' the Duke has permitted <i>Frisoni</i> the Director of his
Buildings to erect a Chapel for the Use of the Catholic Workmen whom he
has sent for from <i>Italy</i> to build the Palace; which Chapel however is
design'd to be demolish'd as soon as the Works are finish'd: But I am
rather inclin'd to think that the Court itself will one day have a
Catholic Chapel; for if the hereditary Prince shou'd happen to die without
Male-Issue, <i>Wirtemberg</i> will fall to the Share of Prince <i>Alexander</i>,
(Cousin-german to the Duke) who has embraced our Religion; and who having
Children by the Princess of <i>Tour</i> and <i>Taxis</i> whom he marry'd at
<i>Brussels</i>, sees them brought up in the Catholic Faith.</p>

<div class="c3"><i>POSTSCRIPT.</i></div>

<p>Since I wrote the above, the Countess <i>de Wurben</i> is fallen under
Disgrace, which I have been told happen'd by this means.</p>

<p>The Duke's Carriage to his Mistress had been cold for some time, when the
King of <i>Prussia</i> came to <i>Ludwigsbourg</i> and exhorted him to be reconcil'd
to his Wife, in order to get Heirs. The Duke cou'd not persuade himself to
take the Duchess again; but however the King's Representations prevail'd
so far, as to put him quite out of conceit with his Mistress. He just kept
up a bare Acquaintance with her, and that was all; which
she<!--316.png--><span class="pagenum">291</span>
perceiv'd,
and made no scruple to try the most extraordinary Methods to maintain
herself in Favour. The Duke having been blooded in her Presence, she
secreted a Napkin stain'd with his Blood. What Use she propos'd to make of
it I know not, but she carry'd it to her Apartment. The Duke's <i>Valets de
Chambre</i> missing the Napkin acquainted their Master of it. M. <i>de Roder</i>,
a Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and a Favourite of his Highness, said that
no body cou'd possibly take it but the Countess, and that to be sure she
did it for no good. The Duke order'd M. <i>de Roder</i> to go to the Countess's
Apartment and enquire into the Fact. <i>Roder</i> ask'd for the Napkin. The
Countess deny'd her having it; but <i>Roder</i> affirm'd he saw her take it,
upon which she was in a Passion with him, and told him she wou'd make him
repent of his Ill-manners to her. <i>Roder</i> made answer, that all the Airs
she gave herself were out of season, that her Reign was over, and that he
wou'd oblige her to return the Napkin. The Countess not us'd to be talk'd
to at such a rate, was frighten'd, and restor'd the fatal Napkin, which
completed her Ruin. The Duke, when inform'd by his Favourite of what had
pass'd, sent an Order to the Countess not to stir from her Apartment: And
this Prince setting out soon after for <i>Berlin</i>, charged the hereditary
Prince his Son to command Madamoiselle <i>de Wurben</i> to retire to her
Estate. The Countess obey'd, and being indulg'd to carry what she had a
mind to along with her, retir'd to a Territory of hers depending
immediately on the Empire, not many Leagues from <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>. There it
was that she heard of the Duke's Reconciliation with the Duchess, upon the
Duke's return from <i>Berlin</i>. This News extremely shock'd her, because she
always flatter'd herself that the Prince wou'd return to her: And
perceiving now that she had no Hopes of being
restor'd<!--317.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
to Favour by the
power of her own Charms, she had a mind to try what she cou'd do by I know
not what Charm in the Magic Art. To carry her Point she was under a
necessity of having a little of the Duke's Blood; and she wrote to his
<i>Valet de Chambre</i>, promising him great Rewards if he cou'd procure her
some. What does the Domestic but carry the Letter to the Duke? who
immediately gave Orders to Colonel <i>Streithorst</i> to arrest the Countess,
and carry her to some Place of Security. The Colonel taking a Detachment
of Soldiers along with him, contriv'd it so that he came to the Countess's
Seat at Night, and immediately surrounding the House, knock'd at the Gate,
but no body making answer he thunder'd so hard at the Gate, that at length
Madame <i>de Sultman</i> the Countess's Sister put her Head out at the Window,
and ask'd who it was that dar'd to make such a Noise. <i>Streithorst</i> told
her his Name, and said he came thither by Order of the Duke. Madame <i>de
Sultman</i> made answer that the Countess was not well, and cou'd not be
spoke with. The Colonel, who knew the contrary, said, that if they did not
let him in he wou'd break open the Doors; upon which they thought fit to
open them. During this the Countess was got to Bed; and <i>Streithorst</i>
entring her Chamber found her there with her Sister and her two
Brothers-in-law, the General <i>N&mdash;&mdash;</i> and <i>Sultman</i>, who was formerly at
<i>Berlin</i> Equerry to the Countess of <i>Wartenberg</i>, and afterwards
Privy-Counsellor to the Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>. The Colonel having signify'd
his Order to the Countess, she affected to be in a dying Condition; but
said that if she was able enough to get up she did not intend it, she
being at home, and in a free House of the Circle of <i>Swabia</i>, from whence
she did not think the Duke had Authority to remove her. The Colonel
threaten'd that his Grenadiers shou'd pull her out of Bed; and the Lady
seeing that she must
obey,<!--318.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
thought fit to rise. She fell on her Knees to
<i>Streithorst</i>; but the hard-hearted Officer was deaf to her Cries, and
conducted her to a place of Security where she is closely confin'd, and
like to be a Prisoner as long as the Duke lives.</p>

<h2>LETTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Carlsrouhe, Feb. 15, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I Deny that any Man can be happier than I am at this Juncture. You have
wrote an excellent long Letter to me; you assure me that you are well, and
that you have still an Affection for me; what more is there wanting to
compleat my Joy? I am preparing to make you the best amends I can, and
instead of a Letter to write you a Volume.</p>

<p>I came in one Day from <i>Ludwigsbourg</i> to <span class="smcap">Carlsrouhe</span>, which is the
Residence of the Margrave of <i>Baden-Dourlach</i>. The Name <i>Carlsrouhe</i>
signifies <i>Charles</i>'s Rest. The present Margrave <i>Charles</i> of
<i>Baden-Dourlach</i> was the very Man that laid both the Plan and Foundation
of this City, and its Castle. Nothing is so pretty as the Disposition of
the whole: I wish I were able to give you an Idea of it. Imagine the
Margrave's House to be at the Entrance of a great Forest, in the Center of
a Star form'd by thirty two Walks, the chief of which behind the Palace is
three <i>German</i> Leagues in length. Two large Wings advance from the main
<!--319.png--><span class="pagenum">294</span>Body
of the House, which deviating from each other in proportion as they
lengthen, the whole together looks like a Theatre. Behind the principal
Building there's a very high Octogon Tower which commands all the Walks.
The Space between the two Wings forms the Court, and then come the Gardens
and Parterres, at the end of which there's a Semi-Circle of Houses of an
equal Height, built Arch-wise, and three Stories high including the
Ground-Floor. Between these Houses there run five Streets, the middlemost
of which fronts the Palace. At the end of the three chief Streets opposite
to the Palace are three Churches; one belonging to the <i>Lutherans</i>,
another to the <i>Calvinists</i>, and a third to the <i>Roman</i> Catholics; to
which three prevailing Religions of the Empire the Margrave gave equal
Liberty of Conscience when he founded the new Town.</p>

<p>The chief part of the Town lies behind the Houses that front the Palace.
This properly speaking consists but of one Street, which is of a
prodigious Length. All these Houses as well as the Margrave's are of
Timber, so that you are not to look for fine or substantial Buildings at
<i>Carlsrouhe</i>; but the Contrivance and Distribution of the whole taken
together is really wonderful. I took the Freedom to tell the Margrave that
I was surpriz'd that he had not at least employ'd Brick in the building of
his Palace, and of the Houses which form the Half-Moon about his Gardens.
'I was wil'ing, <i>said the Prince</i>, to make myself a Place of Retirement,
and to build without putting the Burthen on my Subjects. I chose moreover
to have the Comfort of enjoying what I built. If I had us'd Bricks it
wou'd have cost me a great deal more Money; and I cou'd not have finish'd
my Buildings without laying an extraordinary Impost upon my Country. It
wou'd have taken me
up<!--320.png--><span class="pagenum">295</span>
abundance of Time too, and perhaps I shou'd never
have had the Satisfaction of seeing an end to my Labours. Another Reason
was, that my Country is so scituate as to be liable to be the Theatre of
Wars, and I am not in a Condition to make this a strong Place, nor cou'd I
encompass it with Walls. Do you think therefore that I shou'd have been
justified in laying out a great deal of Money on a Place to see it burnt
down before my Face, as I did my House at <i>Dourlach</i>, and my other Houses
which the <i>French</i> reduc'd to Ashes. I am but a petty Sovereign; I have
built a House according to my Condition, and I had rather it shou'd be
said of me that I have but a mean Habitation, and owe no Money, than that
I have a stately Palace and am over Head and Ears in Debt.'</p>

<p>I have given you this account of what the Margrave said to me, because I
thought it wou'd let you into an Idea of his Character. This Prince, to
whom I was introduc'd on the very day of my Arrival here, took the trouble
himself to shew me his Palace, and all about it. I thought the Apartments
very well laid out, but there is not room enough to lodge the hereditary
Prince, who lives in one of the Houses in the Semi-Circle fronting the
Palace.</p>

<p>The Pheasant-Walk, which joins to the Castle, is the prettiest thing in
the World. 'Tis a very large Inclosure, dispos'd in various Walks planted
with Fir-Trees cut in the shape of a Fan. There's a great Basin in the
Center always full of wild Ducks. 'Tis encompass'd with four Pavilions,
made in the Form of <i>Turkish</i> Tents. Two of the Pavilions are Volarys, and
the two others Summer-Houses, with Window-Curtains of Green Cloth. There
are Sofas and Couches, after the manner of the Eastern Countries. In this
Place of Retirement and
Rest<!--321.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the Margrave spends some Hours every Day,
and he is generally accompany'd by some young Ladies whom he teaches
Music; so that they perform agreeable Concerts.</p>

<p>The Margrave was in the right to give his House the Name of <i>Charles's
Rest</i>, for he leads the most tranquil Life here that can be. Far from
being infatuated with vain Grandeur, he has the Charms of it, without the
Check and Constraint of it. This Prince is of a very robust Constitution,
and tho' he underwent a vast deal of Fatigue in his Youth, he is as
fresh-colour'd and as vigorous as if he was but forty Years of Age. He
travell'd when he was a young Man into the principal parts of <i>Europe</i>;
and during his Father's Life-time was several Years in the Service of
<i>Sweden</i>. When he return'd to his Dominions he serv'd in the Army of the
Empire on the Upper <i>Rhine</i>, under his Cousin Prince <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Baden</i>.
Tho' the Margrave is very fat, yet he uses a great deal of Exercise. He
rises in Summer at five o'Clock in the Morning, and walks in his Gardens
till the Heat of the Weather obliges him to retire within doors; then he
does Business with his Counsellors, or else employs himself in Experiments
of Chymistry, and sometimes he draws. He commonly dines at four o'clock,
and is attended by Waiting-Women, of whom there are no less than
threescore, tho' no more than eight wait upon one Day. These, when the
Margrave goes abroad, attend him on horseback, dress'd like <i>Hussurs</i>. The
Generality of these Damsels understand Music and Dancing; they also
perform Operas at the Theatre of the Palace, and are Musicians of the
Chappel. They have all Lodgings in the Palace. After Dinner is over the
Margrave grants Audience to his Subjects; and upon particular Days of the
Week hears all that come. Few Princes render Justice more speedily, and
more punctually. Sometimes he goes a
Hunting.<!--322.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
He makes very light
Suppers, and retires early to Bed. He delights in Agriculture, and is one
of the greatest Florists living. This Prince is never unemploy'd. There
are few things which he does not know, and very many which he understands
to Perfection. His Conversation is as agreeable as any I know. He speaks
several Languages well. His Behaviour is obliging and courteous. He loves
Foreigners, treats them with Distinction, and loads them with Civilities.
Upon Sundays and Holidays he eats with the Prince his Son, and the
Princess his Daughter-in-law. His Table, which is then spread for sixteen
Guests, is serv'd with more Delicacy than Profusion.</p>

<p>The hereditary Prince<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, only Son to the Margrave, is pretty short, and
has not the Life and Spirit of his Father. He is very complaisant and
civil, and seems to me of a good-natur'd Disposition. He has been at
<i>Paris</i>, in <i>England</i>, and in <i>Holland</i>, where he marry'd the Daughter of
the unfortunate Prince of <i>Nassau</i>, who was drown'd in 1711, as he was
passing the <i>Maerdyke</i> to the <i>Hague</i>, to adjust with <i>Frederic</i> I. King
of <i>Prussia</i>, such Differences as related to the Succession of the late
King <i>William</i> of <i>Great Britain</i>, to which they both laid Claim. The
hereditary Princess seems to me to be well behav'd; and she makes very
handsome Entertainments. The Court assembles at her House every day,
<i>viz.</i> at Noon, and at five o'clock in the Evening; and there they dine,
game, and sup. Foreigners are very well receiv'd there, and both the
Ladies and Gentlemen are very civil and complaisant.</p>

<p>The Grand Marshal, and his Brother the Great Huntsman, are Persons capable
of making a Figure with Distinction in the greatest
Courts.<!--323.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
The first
marry'd a legitimated Daughter of the Margrave.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>d'Ixter</i>, President of the Regency, and Chief of the Council,
is a Person of signal Merit, and capable of any Business, be it ever so
great.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the Margrave's Court is extremely well regulated. This
Prince is fond of the Nobility, and seeks to do them a Pleasure. He has
none but Persons of Quality in his Service. 'Tis great pity that this
Court does not come together again. The Margravine, who is Sister to the
Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>, resides at <i>Dourlach</i>, and never comes to
<i>Carlsrouhe</i> but when 'tis a Holiday, or when some foreign Prince is
there. This Princess is actually very much indispos'd, so that I don't
think I shall have the Honour of kissing her Hand. The Margrave also
educates at his Court three young Princes his Nephews, the Sons of his
Brother. They are under the Government of the Baron <i>de Gemming</i>, who
takes very great Care of their Education.</p>

<p>As to the Margrave's Revenues, I cannot be positive what they are, because
I found that People who ought to know best, vary in their Calculations not
a little; some assur'd me they were 400,000, some 500,000 Florins, and
others much more. Be it as it will, 'tis certain that the Margrave lives
nobly, that every body is well paid, and that the Subjects are not
over-burthen'd. Farewell, Sir, I set out to-morrow for <i>Rastadt</i>, and
shall write to you as soon as I can, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Strasbourg, Feb. 28, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>It took me up no more than four Hours to go from <i>Carlsrouhe</i> to <span class="smcap">Rastadt</span>.
As soon as I alighted there I notified my Arrival to the Grand Marshal,
with a Request that he wou'd procure me the Honour of paying my
Compliments to their Highnesses of <i>Baden-Baden</i>. I had for answer, that
the Margrave was out a Hunting, and that therefore I cou'd not have an
Audience before next day. I had patience to stay; and having by Good luck
some Books at hand, I spent all that day in Reading, and the next day too,
but did not hear a Word from the Grand Marshal. Mean time as I did not
come to <i>Rastadt</i> purely to read, and as 'tis a Town does not afford much
Amusement, since a quarter of an hour is enough to know all the Streets, I
was very chagrin. I sent a second Message to the Grand Marshal, but had
the same Answer as before. I thought it improper to insist any farther,
and gave over all hopes of seeing the Court of <i>Rastadt</i>. However I went
to see the Margrave's Palace, which his Father the late Prince <i>Lewis</i> of
<i>Baden</i> built from the ground. It is very much like to the Palace of <i>St.
Cloud</i> near <i>Paris</i>, and seems to be a Building conducted with more
Regularity than I observ'd in several new Houses in <i>Germany</i> left solely
to the Direction of ignorant Masons, who without a Taste for Building have
the Assurance to call themselves Architects.</p>

<!--325.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>The principal Stair-Case is large and lightsome. The Apartments have all
the Conveniences they can admit of. Those which are contiguous to the
grand Stair-Case are distributed into several Partitions, for Shew and for
Convenience. They are painted, gilt, and gaily furnish'd. The Margravine
Dowager to Prince <i>Lewis</i> put them in this Condition against the Marriage
of her Daughter to the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>; and the Furniture is indeed rich
and well fancy'd. The Keeper shewed me the Closet in which Prince <i>Eugene</i>
of <i>Savoy</i> and Marshal <i>Villars</i> sign'd the Peace in 1714. 'Tis pity that
this truly magnificent Palace has no Gardens to it. There's Ground mark'd
out for that purpose, and if Prince <i>Lewis</i> had liv'd they wou'd have been
finish'd.</p>

<p>After having seen the Apartments and the Chapel, which is small, but
exceedingly adorn'd, not knowing what to do with myself I went to a
Billiard-Table fronting the Palace, where I found some Gentlemen of the
Court as idle as myself. They treated me as a Foreigner, and were
complaisant to me. A young Fellow of a good Appearance, and who seem'd to
have an Air of Politeness, having refus'd as well as myself to play,
enter'd into a Conversation with me: And by degrees that Sympathy of our
Tempers, which was a Stranger to the Laws of Reason, made us talk to one
another with as much Freedom as if we had been old Acquaintance. I
complain'd to him that tho' I had been three days at <i>Rastadt</i> I cou'd not
get an Opportunity of paying my Duty to their Highnesses of <i>Baden</i>. He
told me that I need not be surpriz'd at it; that since the Death of the
late Prince <i>Lewis</i>, the Margravine his Dowager, who was hereditary
Princess of <i>Saxe-Lawenbourg</i>, had introduc'd into her Court the
Ceremonial of the Eastern Princes; that she never appear'd but in a full
Divan,<!--326.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
and that she did not permit any one whatsoever to come near to her
Son except the Bashaws and Dervizes who were of the Council. The young
Gentleman's manner of accounting for this matter made me smile, and put me
upon asking him several Questions. 'How! <i>said I</i>, according to the
Character I have had of the Margravine, she is very much of a Christian,
and of that virtuous Heroine which the wise Man, if he had been still
living, wou'd have propos'd to us for a Model. Indeed, <i>said the
Gentleman</i>, the Character you have had of her is right enough: The
Margravine has Piety and Virtues that render her valuable; but she has a
Haughtiness, and a certain <i>Particularity</i> in her Temper, which is hardly
to be parallell'd. For instance, if she had receiv'd you it wou'd have
been standing under a Canopy by an Arm-Chair, with as much State as the
Empress. She wou'd have ask'd you two or three Questions, after which she
wou'd have assur'd you of her Protection, and then have dismiss'd you
without detaining you to dine with her, as is the manner of all the
Princes of the Empire; but 'tis not the fashion here, <i>continued the
Gentleman</i>. The Margravine commonly dines in private, and we who are of
her Court don't see her but at Mass. The young Margrave our Master wou'd
like well enough to see Company, but his Mother giving him to understand
that she does not care for it, he conforms to her Pleasure. The young
Margravine, who is the Daughter of the Prince <i>de Schwartzenbourg</i>, has no
Authority, because tho' naturally obliging and civil she durst not put her
good Qualities in practice, because the Margravine Dowager reproaches her
that she does not know how to carry it like a Sovereign; by which means
this poor Princess is oblig'd to be proud against her Inclination. If you
were to see
her<!--327.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
you wou'd be charm'd with her; for she is tall and
handsome, of a lively fair Complexion, but not languid, and has a very
noble Air. When the Margrave marry'd her she was an only Daughter, and the
Princess of <i>Schwartzenbourg</i> her Mother, who had not lived with her
Husband for near fifteen Years, was not like to have any more Children.
But the Event has proved contrary; for the Prince and Princess of
<i>Schwartzenbourg</i> are reconcil'd, and the Princess has had a Son, who has
frustrated the Hopes of our young Margravine of being some day or other
one of the richest Heiresses in the Empire. This has not advanc'd her in
the Favour of her Mother-in-law, who often snaps at her; but there being
no Remedy, the young Princess bears her Ill-humours with Patience. As she
is just brought to bed too of a Son, we hope she will have more Interest;
at least 'tis what we all wish, because she is a very good Princess. 'Tis
not a Year, <i>continued the Gentleman</i>, that our young Margrave has been of
Age, nevertheless his Majority is so controll'd by the Ascendancy which
the Dowager keeps over her Son, that it may be said 'tis she who governs
still. This Prince accustom'd to obey knows not what is the Pleasure of
commanding. There's the same likelihood of his being a Dependant as long
as his Mother lives; and indeed he ought to humour that Princess, as well
because she was always a good Mother to him, as for the Advantages she is
capable of doing him; for she is very rich, and has a noble Estate in
<i>Bohemia</i>, which she wou'd perhaps give to her youngest Son, who is Canon
of <i>Cologne</i> and <i>Augsbourg</i>, if the Margrave disobliged her; tho' I
believe it must be a great Offence indeed that wou'd provoke her to
disinherit him, because he was always her Darling, and perhaps too the
most dutiful
of<!--328.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
all her Children. Such is her Tenderness for this Son
that when there was a Talk of his going abroad she wou'd needs go with
him; and she actually accompany'd him all over <i>Italy</i>. Some People were
indeed so ill-natur'd as to say that 'twas not out of Love to the Prince,
but because she was afraid he wou'd wean himself from her Company, and
break quite away from her. 'Tis said however that she is going to quit the
Court, and to retire to <i>Etlingen</i>, which is the Place assign'd for her
Jointure. We all wish it, not that we have any reason to complain of this
Princess, but because we hope then to have a gayer Court. For the rest, to
do the Margravine Dowager Justice, she has manag'd her Son's Finances with
a great deal of &OElig;conomy. When the late Prince <i>Lewis</i> died he left a
heavy Debt upon the Country, which was also ruin'd by the late War. But
the Margravine Regent has paid off all, and so happily retriev'd the
Government and the Finances, that when her Son came of Age she gave him
considerable Sums, and the Country was in a better Condition than ever.'</p>

<p>There the Gentleman concluded. After putting several Questions to him I
learnt that the Duchess of <i>Orleans</i> had been promis'd in Marriage to
Prince <i>Alexander</i> of <i>Tour</i> and <i>Taxis</i><a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>, that the Presents were made
for the Wedding, and that the same was very soon to be celebrated: But
when the Duke of <i>Orleans</i> actually sent M. <i>d'Argenson</i> his Chancellor to
<i>Rastadt</i> to demand the Princess in Marriage, the Margravine her Mother
thinking this a better Match beyond comparison, call'd back the Promise
she had made to the Prince <i>de la Tour</i>, and concluded the Treaty with the
Duke of <i>Orleans</i>. The young Margrave marry'd his Sister by Proxy, in
<!--329.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>presence
of M. <i>d'Argenson</i>, and the Princess was conducted to
<i>Strasbourg</i>, where finding a Set of Domestics sent from <i>Paris</i> to
receive her, she turn'd off all her <i>German</i> Servants and proceeded on her
Journey to <i>Chalons</i>, whither the Duke of <i>Orleans</i> went to meet her.</p>

<p>The same Gentleman from whom I learnt all these Particulars told me
likewise that the young Margrave, before he marry'd the Princess of
<i>Schwartzenbourg</i>, was to have had the Daughter of King <i>Stanislaus</i>, but
that the Margravine broke off the Marriage-Treaty which was very far
advanc'd, because the King was not able to pay down a hundred thousand
Crowns ready Money for his Daughter's Dowry. It was undoubtedly owing to
that Princess's happy Star that the King could not raise the Sum, for in
such case his Daughter would not now have worn one of the first Crowns in
the World. The Gentleman told me moreover that the Margravine was
mortify'd to the last degree when she heard that the Princess whom she had
refus'd for her Daughter-in-law was become the Queen of <i>France</i>. She was
apprehensive too that this Princess or the King her Father would take
revenge for the Slight she had put upon their Alliance, and she wrote a
Letter to King <i>Stanislaus</i> to congratulate him on an Event so glorious to
him, and to recommend to him the Duchess of <i>Orleans</i> her Daughter. <i>I
intreat you, Sir</i>, said she, <i>to prevail with the Queen your Daughter to
honour my Daughter and all my Family with her Favour. I will presume to
say that both I and Mine deserve it at your Hands for the Respect we have
always had for you</i>. This Letter, which was as submissive as the
Margravine's Conduct had been haughty, was receiv'd with very great
Civility by King <i>Stanislaus</i>, who, after having read it to the Queen his
Wife, could not help saying, <i>I am much oblig'd to
the</i><!--330.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
<i>Margravine for
this Letter</i>, and he return'd her a very engaging Answer. 'Tis my Opinion
that at that time, instead of bearing the Princess any Ill-will he took it
very kindly of her that she had refus'd his Daughter for a
Daughter-in-law. The officious Gentleman would perhaps have inform'd me of
other Particulars concerning the Court of <i>Rastadt</i>, if the Margrave's
Return from Hunting had not oblig'd him to go to the Castle. I thank'd him
for the trouble he had given himself, and went and shut my self up at my
Quarters.</p>

<p>I set out next day for <i>Strasbourg</i>, and in less than five Hours arrived
at <span class="smcap">Kehl</span>. 'Tis all an even Country, and admirable Roads. We travel thro'
the Dominions of <i>Spire</i>, the Bishoprick of <i>Strasbourg</i>, and the County
of <i>Hanau</i>. At <i>Kehl</i> I paid a Visit to the General Baron <i>de Roth</i>, the
Governour of the Place, who entertain'd me at Dinner, and made me
exceeding welcome, but so ply'd me with Liquor that I thought my self at
<i>Fulde</i> or <i>Wurtzbourg</i>. After Dinner M. <i>de Roth</i> shewed me the
Fortifications, which I found in a very bad State. The Commandant told me
that he had taken a world of pains to represent it to the Dyet of the
Empire at <i>Ratisbonne</i>, but that he might as well have talk'd to so many
deaf Men. 'Tis certain that if Care be not taken, the <i>Rhine</i> will wash
away the Fort one day or other, and carry it to <i>Holland</i>. The Marshal <i>de
Bourg</i> said to me a while ago when we were talking of <i>Kehl</i>, that M. <i>de
Roth</i> would do well to fasten his Fort with Chains to the Citadel of
<i>Strasbourg</i>.</p>

<p>There's only a Bridge over the <i>Rhine</i> to pass from <i>Kehl</i> to <span class="smcap">Strasbourg</span>
the Capital of <i>Alsace</i>, and formerly an Imperial City. The <i>French</i> made
themselves Masters of it in <i>September</i> 1681, when they came to the very
Gates of the Place before the Town had notice of their March, and when it
was<!--331.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
in no Condition to make resistance; for whether they thought they had
no need of being upon their guard, or whether the chief Burgomasters had
been corrupted, the Town wanted but every thing. The Capitulation was
signed on one side by the Marquis <i>de Louvois</i>, and the Baron <i>de Monclar</i>
Commandant in <i>Alsace</i>; and on the other by eight Deputies of the City,
which was secured in all its Privileges, Prerogatives and Customs, both
ecclesiastical and civil. The Bishop was nevertheless restored to his See,
and the Canons to the Cathedral, which had belonged for 152 Years to the
<i>Lutherans</i>. <i>Lewis</i> XIV. made his entry into <i>Strasbourg</i> the 23d of
<i>October</i> following, and immediately order'd a Citadel and other Works to
be erected, which have since been so augmented that <i>Strasbourg</i> may now
be rank'd among the most important Places of <i>Europe</i>. The Marshal Count
<i>de Bourg</i> commands in it, and has one of the King's Lieutenants under
him, who is always a General Officer. M. <i>Dangervilliers</i><a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> formerly
Intendant of <i>Dauphiny</i>, is Intendant of the Province of <i>Alsace</i> and the
City of <i>Strasbourg</i>. These Gentlemen, whom I have been to see, receiv'd
me with prodigious Civility, and very punctually return'd my Visit.</p>

<p>The Marshal Count <i>de Bourg</i> preserves a stately Mien in an advanced Age,
and one may easily perceive he has been a very fine Man in his time. He
was Page to <i>Philip</i> of <i>France</i> Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, Brother to <i>Lewis</i> the
Great, and to that Duke's Favour his Advancement to Military Employments
is very much owing, tho' 'tis true that he has distinguished himself in
the Service. On
the<!--332.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
26th of <i>August</i> 1709, he defeated near <i>Rumersheim</i>
the Count <i>de Mercy</i>, who commanded a flying Camp of 9000 Men detach'd
from the Army of the Empire, then under Command of the Elector of
<i>Hanover</i>, afterwards <i>George</i> I. King of <i>Great Britain</i>. This Victory
gain'd M. <i>de Bourg</i> the blue Ribbon. King <i>Lewis</i> XV. gave him the Staff
of a Marshal of <i>France</i>, and confirmed him in the Government of
<i>Strasbourg</i>. The <i>French</i> Officers accuse this Marshal of Pride, but for
my part, I have all the Reason that can be to love him for his Civility.</p>

<p>M. <i>Dangervilliers</i> is really more engaging than the Marshal, and is
therefore more beloved by the Officers. He is affable and civil,
complaisant to Foreigners, and lives with a vast deal of Splendor. The
Princes of the Empire that border upon <i>Alsace</i> like him very well, and
think he is more candid, and less haughty than his Predecessors.</p>

<p>There's not many of the Nobility settled in this City, and of these few
that are wealthy; and therefore they live very much retir'd. The Canons of
the Great Chapter who ought all to be Princes or Counts, are not of very
great Service, because most of 'em holding other Benefices, only come to
<i>Strasbourg</i> to pass away three Months there of their Residence, and by
consequence they are here as Strangers. The best Houses therefore are the
Intendant's and the King's Lieutenant's. There are always a great many
Officers here who are indeed amiable Fellows, and know how to serve, and
to be good Company too upon occasion. The Commandants of the Corps are in
Years, and Officers of Experience, and the rest are clever smart Youths
who long sadly to be fighting, and would fain make you believe the four
Corners of the World will quickly be on fire. I have not seen finer
Infantry than the <i>French</i> Infantry at this present time.
There<!--333.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
are very
fine Gentlemen too in the Cavalry, but then they are not near so well
mounted as ours. You know the Cry with us is that the <i>French</i> are ruin'd,
and not able to do any thing more. How the Case stands with them, I really
know not, but if one may judge of it by Appearances, it cannot be so. No
Troops were ever better cloathed, better paid, more spruce, nor finer. The
Officers are splendid; they game, divert themselves, and eat and drink
well, which does not seem to me to be the Life of People in want. Upon
these terms, I would be content to be in such want all my Life long.</p>

<p>The Garrison maintains a Company of Comedians who are paid by the
Captains, and commanding Officers, for the Subalterns are admitted
<i>gratis</i>. The Theatre, which is one of the prettiest in the Country, is
maintain'd by the City.</p>

<p>A Man that has a Taste for a plain home-bred Girl may here find Amusement
and good Blood. 'Tis observ'd that the <i>Lutheran</i> Women are the most
beautiful, and the Sex at this Place is said to be very indulgent, and
very tractable; so that I should be apt to think, a Man need not be very
open-hearted to them.</p>

<p>Tho' <i>Strasbourg</i> may be reckon'd among the finest Towns in <i>France</i>, one
can't say there's a single House in it that is magnificent, or makes a
grand Appearance. The Cathedral is a very stately Building of <i>Gothic</i>
Architecture; its famous Spire is one of the most lofty, and of the
neatest Workmanship of any in <i>Europe</i>. <i>Misson</i>, who 'tis like always
carried his Plummet and Foot-Rule in his Pocket, because he never fails to
give the Length and Breadth and Height of a Thing, says that 'tis 574 Foot
in height; and I believe he is not mistaken. <i>Erkivin de Stembach</i> who was
the Architect, finish'd it in the Year 1449. 'Tis said that <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
had a mind to have a Spire erected upon the
second<!--334.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Tower which seems to
have been built with that View. He order'd M. <i>de Vauban</i> to draw a Model
of it, and to compute the Cost, which he found would amount to several
Millions of Livres. The King thinking that he could employ that Sum to a
better purpose, contented himself with making a Present to the Cathedral
of the Ornaments, and all the Priests Vestments for celebrating Mass upon
the several annual Festivals; the whole of which is extraordinary
sumptuous, and becoming the Magnificence of one of the greatest Kings in
the World. 'Twas in the Cathedral of <i>Strasbourg</i> that the Duke of
<i>Orleans</i> the first Prince of the Blood of <i>France</i> married as Proxy to
<i>Lewis</i> XV. <i>Mary Lescinski</i>, the Daughter of King <i>Stanislaus</i>. This
Ceremony, at which I was present, was more magnificent than what was
observ'd at <i>Fontainbleau</i> at the Queen's Arrival; and the Concourse of
<i>German</i> Noblemen and Princes hither upon the Occasion was prodigious. The
Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i>, as Bishop of <i>Strasbourg</i>, gave the Nuptial
Benediction. Nothing can be finer than the Speeches which his Eminency
made upon that Solemnity: As they fell into my hands, I think I ought to
communicate them to you. You will find them <i>verbatim</i> at the End of this
Letter. <i>Poland</i> in this Instance, made a worthy Restitution to <i>France</i>,
which many Years ago gave the <i>Poles</i> a King who was afterwards the
unfortunate <i>Henry</i> III; and they have now in their turn given a Queen to
<i>France</i>. But <i>Germany</i> may boast that the Queen derives from the Empire
that Fund of Virtue which is the Source of her Happiness, and makes her
admir'd by the Universe. <i>France</i> had for a long time left off sending to
our Climates for her Queens. <i>Mary-Anne Victoria</i> of <i>Bavaria</i> was in a
fair way to be one, but she died a Dauphiness<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. <i>Lorrain</i>, <i>Scotland</i>,
<i>Italy</i> and
<i>Spain</i>,<!--335.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
had as it were engross'd the Crown of <i>France</i> for
their Princesses. But I hope the Virtues of the present Queen and the
other <i>German</i><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Princesses who are now at the Court of <i>France</i> will
oblige the <i>French</i> to confess that if our Princesses have not Crowns for
their Dowries like the Infanta's of <i>Spain</i>, they have an Estate of more
Value than all the Wealth in the World, <i>viz.</i> Piety, Charity, and Love
for the People.</p>

<p>A great many young <i>German</i> Gentlemen come hither for the sake of learning
<i>French</i>, and their Exercises, but I don't think they are a jot the better
for it, because the Masters of their Exercises are not better Scholars
here than they are in many Towns of <i>Germany</i>; and as to the <i>French</i>,
they speak it very ill in this City; for the Inhabitants talk
<i>High-Dutch</i>, and our young Sparks are so pleas'd to hear their own
Language spoke that they neglect to learn any other. Besides they always
herd together, and too easily catch one another's Vices as well as
Virtues. As they have not many Parts to shew, they spend their time at the
Billiard-Table, the Coffee-House, and often at other Places not so honest,
of which there are but too many here, this being a City as noted for
Libertines as any in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Speech of Cardinal <span class="f">de Rohan</span> to the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span><i>, before the Celebration of

<div>
<i>MADAME</i>,
</div>

<p>'While I see you in this sacred Temple approaching to our Altars to
contract that illustrious Alliance which is to unite you to the greatest
of Kings and the most amiable of Princes,
I<!--336.png--><span class="pagenum">311</span>
adore what God designs you
for, and admire with Transport the Course that Providence is steering to
conduct you to the Throne which you are going to ascend. You are
descended, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, from a Family illustrious for its Antiquity, for its
Alliances, and for the eminent Employments which the great Men it has
given to <i>Poland</i> have fill'd successively with so much Glory. You are the
Daughter of a Father, who, thro' the various Events of a busy Life,
chequer'd by good and bad Fortune, has always shewn himself the Gentleman,
the Hero, and the Christian. You have for your Mother, and your
Grandmother, Princesses, who like to <i>Judith</i>, and to that virtuous Woman
whose Character is drawn in the Scriptures, have attracted the Veneration
and Respect of the whole World, by the Fidelity with which they always
walk'd in the Fear of the Lord. In your Person, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, are center'd all
the Accomplishments that can be form'd by a happy Birth, and an admirable
Education, supported by Examples equally strong and affecting. In you,
that Goodness, that Mildness, and those Charms are predominant, which gain
Love at the same time as they inforce Respect; that Integrity of Heart
which nothing can resist; that Superiority of Understanding and Knowledge
which are conspicuous, as it were in spite of you, and in spite of that
Modesty and noble Simplicity which are natural to you; and finally that
which is the Crown of so much Merit, that Taste for Piety, and that
Attachment to the true Principles of Religion, which animate your Actions,
and regulate your Conduct. Adorn'd with all these Virtues, what Crown is
there to which you might not reasonably aspire, exclusive of the Custom
which in some measure obliges Kings to look no farther than round the
Throne for Princesses that they have a mind would reign with
them?<!--337.png--><span class="pagenum">312</span>
He who
disposes of Empires puts the Sceptre of <i>Poland</i> into the hands of a
Prince to whom you owe your Being, and by giving the Father that Splendor
conducts the Daughter insensibly to the sublime Station he is preparing
for her. But, O God, how impenetrable are thy Designs, and how far above
human Prudence are the Means thou makest use of to bring about thy wise
Purposes! This Prince was scarce seated on the Throne in which the Choice
of the Grandees, and the Affection of the People had plac'd him, but he
was oblig'd to quit it: He is abandon'd, betray'd, persecuted; one fatal
Shot bereaves him of the Hero his Friend, and the chief Stay of his Hopes:
He submits to the necessity of the Times without abating in his Courage:
He seeks refuge in a Country which is the common Shelter of unfortunate
Kings: He comes to <i>France</i>, and thither, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, you are following him.
All that see you there, touch'd with your Misfortunes, admire your Virtue,
the Odour of which spreads to the Throne of a young Monarch, who, such is
the Lustre of his Crown, the Extent of his Power, and above all, the
Charms of his Person, might have made his choice out of all the Princesses
of the World: But being guided by wise Counsels, he fixes it upon You; and
here the Finger of God is plainly visible in improving that very
Misfortune which separates the King your Father from his Subjects, and
takes you out of <i>Poland</i> to give Us in your Person, a Queen who shall be
the Glory of a Father and of a Mother, of whom she is now the Comfort and
Delight; a Queen, who shall render that Nation happy which most richly
deserves it, at least for its Respect and its Fidelity to its Sovereigns;
a Queen, who being inviolably attach'd to her Duty, full of Tenderness and
Respect for her Husband, and her King, and
wisely<!--338.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
employ'd in what is
capable of procuring her solid Happiness, will revive to us the Reign of
the Empress <i>Flaccilla</i>, of whom History says, that having always kept the
Precepts of the Divine Law in her view, she conferr'd thereupon daily with
the great <i>Theodosius</i>, and that her Words like a fruitful Rain, water'd
with success those Seeds of Virtue which God had sown in the Heart of her
Husband. Come then, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, Come to the Altar. May the Engagements you are
going to enter into, sacred of themselves, (since according to the
Apostle, they are the Symbol of the Union of Jesus Christ with his Church)
may they be also sanctify'd by your own Disposition. May you be so
sensible of what you are going to be, that you may acknowledge that in
crowning your Merits, he crowns his Gifts: And may you Christians that
hear me, when you see the shining Rewards that are bestowed in this World
upon true Virtue, learn to respect and love it.'</p>

<p><i>The Cardinal's Speech after the Celebration of the Marriage.</i></p>

<div>
<i>MADAME</i>,
</div>

<p>'Now that august Ceremony is ended which crowns our Hopes and our Wishes;
give me leave to desire your Majesty's Royal Protection for the Church of
<i>Strasbourg</i>. This Church has not forgot and never will forget the signal
Favours it has received from our former Kings. How great are its
Obligations to our last Monarch! Being deliver'd up by the Misfortunes of
the Times to the Furys of Schism and Heresy, it would perhaps have
perish'd as many others did, if that great Prince, by resuming the Rights
of his Ancestors, had not undertaken its defence, and supported it with
all his Power. To him it is oblig'd for
the<!--339.png--><span class="pagenum">314</span>
Advantage of being restored
to the Possession of this sacred Temple from which it had been banished.
There's nothing here but what puts us in mind of his Pious and Royal
Magnificence. Temples adorn'd, Pastors liberally maintain'd, Missions
founded, new Converts protected and supported, are so many Monuments of
the Zeal and Piety of a King whose Memory will never die. He had not the
Comfort to finish the Work which he had undertaken; that is to say, the
reuniting of all the Sheep of this illustrious Flock in one and the same
Fold: This was reserv'd to the worthy Heir of his Zeal and Crown. It will
be your part, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, to represent to your August Spouse how much the
Remembrance of his Great Grandfather, his own Glory, and our Necessities,
which are even those of Religion, require of him. You will not desire that
Recourse shou'd be had to those Methods which exasperate, without
persuading; such would not be to your Majesty's liking, and God forbid
that we should suggest them to you. Those Children who disown us are your
Subjects, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, and the Church of <i>Strasbourg</i> confiding intirely in
God's Mercy, still looks on itself as their Mother. We therefore conjure
you by the Bowels of Jesus Christ, to employ, for the sake of uniting
them, every Thing with which an active but sympathizing Charity may
inspire you. God will bless your Majesty's Endeavours, and our Desires,
and will employ the Instances of your Piety and your Faith to the total
Confusion of Error, and the Triumph of the Truth. May your Reign be long
over us, <span class="smcap">Madame</span>, for the Happiness of the King, and the Welfare of this
great Kingdom. May God hear the Prayers which the Church has now offer'd
up for your Majesty, and may you be so good as to place us in the Rank of
your most zealous and most faithful Subjects.'</p>

<h2>LETTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Heidelberg, March 12, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>Being in the Neighbourhood of <span class="smcap">Saverne</span> where the Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i> lives,
I had a mind to go thither. I have had the Honour to be known to that
Prelate a long time, and was overjoy'd at the opportunity of paying my
respects to him.</p>

<p><i>Armand Gaston</i> Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i> was elected Bishop of <i>Strasbourg</i> the
10th of <i>April</i> 1704<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, and received the Cardinal's Cap from the Hands
of <i>Lewis</i> XIV. the 18th of <i>May</i>, 1712. The Year following he succeeded
the Cardinal <i>de Janson</i> as Great Almoner. The Emperor granted him the
Temporal Investiture of the See of <i>Strasbourg</i><a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
on<!--341.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
the 10th of
<i>June</i> 1723, and in 1724, he obtain'd a Seat in the College of Princes at
the Assembly of <i>Ratisbon</i>. This Prelate who is considerable for his Birth
and Dignities, is much more so for his great Soul, his polite and obliging
Behaviour, and for an Air of Grandeur which accompanies all his Actions.
He is a comely Person, as are indeed all of his Family. Being noble and
magnificent in every thing that he does, he lives wherever he is like a
great Nobleman, but particularly at <i>Saverne</i>. I found at his Palace the
Duke and Duchess of <i>Tallard</i>, the Duchess <i>de la Meilleraie</i>,
Madamoiselle <i>de Melun</i>, the Prince and Princess of <i>Birkensfield</i>, M.
<i>Dangervilliers</i>, the Intendant of <i>Strasbourg</i>, the Count and Princess of
<i>Hanau</i>, and in short a great many Officers of Distinction. They had all
convenient Lodgings and Accommodation in the Castle; and Gaming, taking
the Air, Hunting, Music, and Good Cheer were their constant Diversions.</p>

<p>The Bishops of <i>Strasbourg</i> have resided for a long time at the Palace of
<i>Saverne</i>, which was always a convenient House; but the Cardinal <i>de
Roban</i> has made it very considerable. The outside of this Palace is not so
magnificent as the inside. The Entry which leads to the chief Stair-Case
is lighted to great advantage, and has several Outlets that have a
convenient Communication with the lower Apartments, which are high, and
very finely embellish'd. The principal Stair-Case is very grand, and leads
to a stately Salon with most curious Decorations. It has a double
Apartment which is render'd as commodious as possible; and the Furniture
consists of Embroidery of Gold and Silver, which may be thought perhaps
too rich. The Queen, who lodg'd at the Cardinal's House when she came to
<i>Saverne</i>, was charm'd with the Splendor of it, and the extraordinary
Respect with which she was attended here.</p>

<!--342.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>The Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i> designs that this rich Furniture shall remain
annex'd to the See; for which his Successor will certainly have very great
Obligations to him: But his Eminence was not so much oblig'd to his
Predecessors; for when he was chose Bishop he found a House very much out
of order, and scarce a Chair in it, whereas 'tis now fit for a King. His
Eminency is about making very large fine Gardens, which are in very great
forwardness, and perfectly answerable to the Grandeur and Beauty of the
Palace; and at the end of them there is a stately Canal which cost
infinite Labour and Expence. The whole of it is the more magnificent
because <i>Saverne</i> stands at the foot of very high Mountains; and in
digging the Canal the Workmen often met with Rocks which they were forc'd
to blow up.</p>

<p>At the Cardinal's Table there's both Abundance and Elegance; and his
Eminency entertains in such a manner as really charms his Guests. All his
Domestics follow his example; and 'tis certain that they are all very
diligent; and that there is not a House in <i>France</i>, or in <i>Europe</i>, where
there's better Attendance. His Eminency's Houshold, and all his Temporal
Affairs in general, are directed by the Abbott <i>de Ravanne</i>, Counsellor in
the Parliament of <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>The Cardinal is one of the richest Noblemen in <i>France</i>, and without
dispute the most expensive. He has built a Hotel at <i>Paris</i>, and furnish'd
it sumptuously. He has made considerable Works at <i>Saverne</i>, and laid out
a great deal of Money in Plate, Furniture, Pictures, antique Vessels, and
Busts, Medals, and Books. Some time ago he purchas'd of the President
<i>Menard</i> the famous Library of the illustrious Messieurs <i>de Thou</i>,
formerly one of the most celebrated in <i>France</i>; and he daily in-riches
<!--343.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>it
with all the most curious and uncommon Books and Manuscripts.</p>

<p>Besides all these Expences, the Cardinal intends also to build a new
episcopal Palace at <i>Strasbourg</i><a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>, where he is indeed but
indifferently lodg'd at present. The Marquiss <i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i> talking of the
Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i>'s Expence, said, <i>That, to be sure, his Eminency had
found out the Philosopher's Stone</i>. I think so too, and that he has done
it by procuring himself five or six hundred thousand Livres a-year in good
Benefices.</p>

<p>From <i>Saverne</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Haguenau</span>, and to <span class="smcap">Weissenbourg</span>, formerly Imperial
Cities, and now subject to <i>France</i>, but Places of little consequence.
King <i>Stanislaus</i> after the Death of <i>Charles</i> XII. King of <i>Sweden</i>,
being forc'd to quit <i>Deux-Ponts</i> to which he had retired with his Family,
came and resided at <i>Weissenbourg</i>; and here it was that he receiv'd the
first Proposals that were made to him for the Marriage of his Daughter
with King <i>Lewis</i> XV. I came and took up my Quarters at <span class="smcap">Landau</span>, one of the
most scoundrel Places in the World, but the best fortify'd; and famous for
having stood out several Sieges. The Emperor <i>Joseph</i> took it when he was
King of the <i>Romans</i>. The <i>French</i> retook it a little before the signing
of the Peace at <i>Rastadt</i>, by which Treaty it was left in their hands.
They maintain a good Garison in it, and have added several Works to it.</p>

<p>From <i>Landau</i> I pass'd to <span class="smcap">Brhousel</span>, with an Intention to pay my respects
to the Cardinal <i>de Schonborn</i> Bishop of <i>Spire</i> who resides there, but I
did not succeed better there than at <i>Rastadt</i>; for his Eminency excus'd
himself from seeing me because he was going a hunting, and put me off till
next day; but I did not think it worth while to wait, what had happen'd to
me at the Court of <i>Baden</i> being too fresh in my Memory. I was afraid of
the<!--344.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
same Fate at <i>Brhousel</i>, where I lay at such sorry Quarters that I
cou'd not avoid catching Cold, my Lodging-Room being without Glass, and be
famish'd into the bargain, there being nothing to eat: Besides, my
Landlord told me that the Cardinal made even those People who came to him
upon Business dance attendance for three or four days. I said to my self
therefore that he had much more reason to make me wait, who came to his
Court out of meer Curiosity. I resolv'd therefore, as any Gentleman ought
to have done in the like case, and took the opportunity of the Cardinal's
Absence to go and view the outside of his Palace. 'Tis a great Structure
not yet entirely finish'd, which the Cardinal has hitherto carry'd on from
the very Foundation; but if I must be sincere with you, all these Works,
considerable as they are, have been form'd upon pitiful Plans. It has cost
a very large Sum of Money; and I fancy that in the time of the ancient
<i>Teutonics</i>, it wou'd have been reckon'd a very fine Structure. The chief
Beauty of it lies in its Situation; for a great Variety of agreeable
Objects are discovered from the Apartments. The Gardens are also so new
that one can scarce know the Plan of 'em; it seems to me that they are not
of an extraordinary Taste, and that they wou'd be much more suitable for a
private Man than for a Sovereign.</p>

<p>The Cardinal <i>de Schonborn</i> is a keen Sportsman. He has Game enough in his
own Bishoprick, for the Country so abounds with all sorts that the Fields
are ruin'd by the Deer. The Peasants are so hard put to it to preserve
their Corn that they are oblig'd to watch it day and night. The Cardinal
often makes Hunting-Matches for the Stag and wild Boar, in which they kill
hundreds; at such times the Peasants are oblig'd to take a certain
quantity of Meat, for which they pay so much
a<!--345.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Pound, according to a
Price that is regulated. The Bishoprick of <i>Spire</i> is one of the
fruitfullest Provinces in <i>Germany</i>, but the Inhabitants are extremely
poor; for their Provisions lie on their hands, and they have scarce
wherewithal to pay the great Taillies due to their Sovereigns.</p>

<p>The Dignity of the Bishop of <i>Spire</i> is elective, as are all the
Bishopricks of <i>Germany</i> which are not in the hereditary Dominions of the
House of <i>Austria</i>. The Bishop is Sovereign of the Country, but the City
of <i>Spire</i> has particular Privileges, as have all the Imperial Cities. You
know it was at <i>Spire</i> that the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. establish'd the
Imperial Chamber, which is as it were the Parliament of the Empire. The
<i>French</i> having destroy'd <i>Spire</i> when they ravag'd the <i>Palatinate</i>, the
Chamber or supreme Tribunal was transferred to <i>Wetzlar</i> in <i>Wetteravia</i>,
where indeed it seem'd to be more in the Center of <i>Germany</i>, and secur'd
from all manner of Insult.</p>

<p><i>Damien-Hugo</i> Count <i>de Schonborn</i> Cardinal, is at this present Bishop of
<i>Spire</i>, and Co-adjutor of <i>Constance</i>. He is also grand Commander of the
Teutonic-Order. He was heretofore a Member of the Emperor's Privy-Council,
and his Plenipotentiary to the Circle of Lower <i>Saxony</i>. <i>Clement</i> XI. of
the <i>Albani</i> Family honour'd him with the Purple. He is descended of a
Family in which Merit has happen'd to be back'd by Fortune. The Cardinal's
Father was the first Count of it. He was also one of the Emperor's
Privy-Council, and Brother to <i>Lotharius-Francis</i> Elector of <i>Mentz</i> and
Bishop of <i>Bamberg</i>. The Cardinal has actually a Brother who is Elector of
<i>Triers</i>, another who is Bishop of <i>Wurtzbourg</i> and <i>Bamberg</i>, whom I have
mention'd to you upon other occasions; and lastly, a third who is a
Counsellor of State<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> to the
Emperor,<!--346.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
and is now the Head of the
Family. Messieurs <i>de Schonborn</i> had formerly an Elector of <i>Mentz</i> in
their Family, who was at the same time Bishop of <i>Wurtzbourg</i>, but that
Prince left them no great Estate; so that they were not very rich when
<i>Lotharius-Francis</i>, Uncle to them all, was chose Elector of <i>Mentz</i>. But
this Prince procur'd them both Wealth and Honours, and render'd the Count
<i>de Schonborn</i>, who is Counsellor of State to the Emperor, one of the
richest Noblemen in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Brhousel</i> to <i>Heidelberg</i> there's one of the finest Countries in the
World, planted with Fruit, and especially Walnut-Trees, which bring in a
great Revenue.</p>

<p>The City of <span class="smcap">Heidelberg</span>, upon the <i>Necker</i>, is very much pent up by that
River, and a Chain of Hills, so that 'tis not near so broad as 'tis long.
This City is the Capital of the Lower <i>Palatinate</i>, and was formerly the
Residence of the Electors. Here is a University which was founded in 1346,
by <i>Robert</i> Prince <i>Palatine</i>, who was chose King of the <i>Romans</i>. No Town
has smarted more by the Scourge of War. Since the Disgrace of <i>Frederic</i>
Elector <i>Palatine</i>, whom the <i>Bohemians</i> chose for their King, it has been
taken, plunder'd, or burnt four times. In 1622, the Emperor's General
<i>Tilly</i> put 500 <i>Palatines</i> in it to the Sword, and at the same time the
Emperor carry'd off the famous Library, which he gave in part to <i>Urban</i>
VIII. who caused it to be placed in the <i>Vatican</i>, where 'tis still to be
seen. In 1634, <i>Heidelberg</i> was besieg'd twice. <i>John de Werth</i> took it
for <i>Lewis</i> XIV. but not being able to carry the Castle he retir'd. Not
many days after, the Marshals <i>de Force</i> and <i>Brezé</i> forc'd the Quarters
of the <i>Germans</i>, and took both the Town and Castle. The <i>French</i> took
this City a third time in 1688, and again in 1693,
which<!--347.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
was the last
time, Sword in hand; at what time they committed Cruelties shocking to
remember, and of which there are woful Marks still left in <i>Heidelberg</i>,
and all the Towns in the <i>Palatinate</i>. This City was beginning to recover
it self by the Elector's residing there, when it brought a more heavy
Disgrace upon it self than all the Misfortunes it had suffer'd by the War.
The Case was thus:</p>

<p>The great Church of <i>Heidelberg</i> since the Peace of <i>Westphalia</i> belongs
half to <i>Roman</i> Catholics, and half to the <i>Calvinists</i>, of whom the
former have the Choir, and the others the Body, and nothing but a thin
Partition separates the two Communions. The Choir not being big enough to
contain the Catholics when the Court resided at <i>Heidelberg</i>, the Elector
propos'd to the <i>Calvinists</i> to yield him the Body of the Church,
alledging that not only the Choir was too scanty, but that he shou'd be
very glad that the Church in which the <i>Palatine</i> Princes lie interr'd
were altogether Catholic. He promis'd at the same time that another Church
should be built for them larger and finer than what they were to yield to
him. The <i>Calvinists</i> said that the great Church had been granted to them
by the Treaty of <i>Munster</i>; that all the Princes who were Guarantees of
the Peace of <i>Westphalia</i> were engag'd to preserve them in the enjoyment
of it; that therefore they could not give it up without violating that
Treaty, which was their Security, and without rendring themselves unworthy
of the Protection of the Protestant Powers. The Elector, in order to
remove those Obstacles, consented that the Powers who were Guarantees of
the <i>Westphalian</i> Treaty of Peace, in which the Church he desir'd was
expressly mentioned, should be Guarantees of the Church which he promis'd
should be built for them: But all these Offers how reasonable soever were
not accepted
by<!--348.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the <i>Calvinists</i>. The Elector being thereby incens'd,
made use of his Sovereign Authority, and took by force what they were not
willing to yield to him; whereupon the <i>Calvinists</i> had recourse to the
Protestant Princes of the Empire, the <i>Lutherans</i> as well as the
<i>Calvinists</i>, who constituting but one Body and one Communion when the
Catholics are to be oppos'd, united together, and engag'd in their Quarrel
the Kings of <i>Great Britain</i>, <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Sweden</i>, and <i>Prussia</i>, and the
<i>States-General</i>. These Powers caused the Catholic Churches in their
Dominions to be shut up, sequester'd the Estates of the Convents, and made
such Clamors and Menaces that the Elector was oblig'd to reinstate the
<i>Calvinists</i> in the Nave of the Church; but he was so angry with the
Inhabitants of <i>Heidelberg</i> for their Disrespect to him that he remov'd
his Residence to <i>Manheim</i>. The Burghers were not very sorry at first for
the Departure of the Court; for being accustom'd to its Absence, they
flattered themselves that the Tribunals of the Regency, which, since the
Accession of the <i>Newbourg</i> Family to the Electorate, had constantly been
kept at <i>Heidelberg</i>, would remain there still. But they were soon thrown
into the utmost Consternation when they saw those Tribunals follow the
Elector. They went and cast themselves at the Feet of their angry
Sovereign, and asking his Pardon for having affronted him, they offer'd
him the Church which was the cause of his Displeasure, and conjur'd him to
return to their City. But all their Supplications were fruitless; the
Elector was stedfast in his Resolution to punish <i>Heidelberg</i>, and
abandon'd it for ever. <i>Heidelberg</i> having no Trade, and subsisting only
by the Court, or by the Tribunals of the Regency, of which it was totally
depriv'd, falls now into decay, and will, no doubt, e'er 'tis long dwindle
to little or nothing.</p>

<!--349.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>The Elector's Palace is higher than the City, and situate in such a manner
that there's a Prospect from the great Apartments quite through the
Opening between the Mountains, by which the <i>Necker</i> runs into the Plain.
The Palace is built of Free-Stone, and is a magnificent Structure. The
greatest part of it was burnt by the <i>French</i> when they destroy'd the
<i>Palatinate</i>: The Lodging-Rooms that are subsisting are very substantial,
tho' not built in the modern Taste. The Apartments are large, but want
Ornament, especially since they have been stript of their Furniture. The
Gardens were formerly reckon'd the finest in <i>Germany</i>; but there's scarce
any thing left of them except the Place where they flourished. If one may
judge of what they were by their Situation, they must have been very
pleasant, by reason of the extensive Prospect they afforded into the
Country.</p>

<p>I do not intend to detain you with an Account of the famous Tun, <i>Misson</i>
having given a more exact Description of that than of many Towns which he
treats of. You will in his <i>Travels</i> find a Cut of this Vessel, which will
give you a more perfect Idea of it than any Narrative whatsoever. The
Elector <i>John-William</i>, the Predecessor of the present Elector, gave a
Companion to this Tun, which is not altogether so large, but much more
adorn'd. They are both full of Wine. I remember that in 1719, when I was
at the <i>Palatine</i> Court, the Elector ask'd me at Table whether I had seen
the Great Tun; and upon my saying that I had not, that Prince, than whom
there was not a more gracious Sovereign in the whole World, told me he
would carry me to it. He made a Proposal to the Princess his Daughter, who
was marry'd to the hereditary Prince of <i>Sullzbach</i>, to go thither after
Dinner was over; which she accepted. The Trumpets led the way, and the
Court followed
in<!--350.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
great Ceremony. When we had mounted the Platform which
is over the Tun, the Elector did me the honour to drink to me out of the
<i>Wilkom</i>, which was a Silver gilt Cup, of a large dimension. He took it
off clean at one Draught, and having caused it to be replenished, sent it
to me by a Page. Good Manners, and the Respect I ow'd to the Elector's
Commands, not permitting me to refuse the Chalice, I begg'd heartily that
he would suffer me to drink it off at several Draughts; which was indulg'd
me; and the Elector talking in the mean time with the Ladies, I took the
opportunity of his Absence, and made no scruple to deceive him, for I
return'd great part of the Wine to the bottom of the Tun, threw a part of
it on the ground, and the rest, which was the least part of it, I drank. I
thought my self well off that he did not perceive in what manner I bubbled
him; for I saw he was very well pleased with me. Then several other great
Glasses went round, and the very Ladies wet their Lips, which was the
thing that effectually contributed to demolish us. I was one of the first
that was overpower'd. I perceived those convulsive Motions that threaten'd
me if I drank any more, therefore I sneak'd off and made the best of my
way down from the Platform. I was endeavouring to get out of the Vault,
but was stop'd at the Door by two Life-Guard Men, who with their Carabines
crossing each other, cry'd, <i>Stand, there's no coming this way</i>. I
conjur'd them to let me pass, and told them that I had very important
Reasons for my departure; but I might as well have talk'd to the Wind. I
found my self in a terrible Quandary: To get up again to the head of the
Tun was Death: What would become of me I could not tell. In short I crept
under the Tun, and there hoped to hide my self; but it was a fruitless
Precaution: There's no avoiding a Man's Destiny. It was
my<!--351.png--><span class="pagenum">326</span>
Fate to be
carry'd out of the Vault, and to know nothing of the matter. For the
Elector perceiv'd I was a Deserter, and I heard him say, <i>Where is he?
What's become of him? Let him be look'd after, and brought up to me dead
or alive</i>. The Guards at the Door being examin'd said that I came that way
in order to get out, but that they sent me back again. All these
Inquiries, which I heard from my Hole, made me burrow my self the more. I
crept under the Covert of a couple of Boards I met with by chance, where
nothing but a Cat, Devil, or Page could possibly find me out. But a little
Page, who was indeed both Devil and Page too, ferreted me, and baul'd out
like one that was mad, <i>Here he is! Here he is!</i> and then I was taken out
of my Covert. You may imagine what a silly Figure I made. I was carry'd
before my Judge, who was the Elector himself. But I took the liberty to
challenge both him and all the Gentlemen in his Retinue, as being Parties
in the Cause. <i>Alas! my little Gentleman</i>, said the Prince to me, <i>You
refuse us for your Judges; I will appoint you others then, and we shall
see whether you come off any better</i>. He nominated the Princess his
Daughter, and her Ladies to try me, and the Elector was my Accuser. After
pleading my own Cause they put it to the Vote, and I was condemn'd
unanimously to drink as long as I could swallow. The Elector said, that as
he was the Sovereign he would mitigate my Sentence; that I should that day
drink four Pint Glasses of Wine, and that for a Fortnight running I should
tip off the like Glass to his Health immediately after Dinner. Every body
admir'd the Elector's Clemency, and whether I did or not, I was fain to do
as they did, and to return him Thanks. Then I underwent the heaviest part
of my Sentence; I did not lose my Life indeed, but for some Hours I lost
both my Speech and
my<!--352.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Reason. I was carry'd to a Bed, where when I came
to my self I was told that my Accusers were in the same pickle as I was;
and that none of them went out of the Vault in the same manner as they
enter'd it. Next day the Elector was so good as to mitigate the remaining
part of my Sentence, and excus'd me from the Penance to which I was
condemn'd, upon my promising him that I wou'd make one at his Table for a
Month to come.</p>

<h2>LETTER XX.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Manheim, March 17, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>In going from <i>Heidelberg</i> to <span class="smcap">Manheim</span> we leave the <i>Necker</i> on the right
hand, but keep almost all the way by the side of that River. 'Tis three
Leagues from one City to the other, over a fruitful Plain. <i>Manheim</i> lies
between the <i>Rhine</i> and the <i>Necker</i>, in a marshy Country, which has
always been reckon'd very unwholesome. About fourscore Years ago this City
was but a Village. <i>Frederic</i> Elector <i>Palatine</i>, who was chose King of
<i>Bohemia</i>, caus'd it to be fortify'd, and built a Castle or Citadel there,
which he call'd <i>Fredericsbourg</i>. At the same time a Town was built, of
which all the Streets run parallel, the chief that passes thro' the middle
of the Town was planted with Trees after the manner of <i>Holland</i>. But the
<i>French</i> having taken <i>Manheim</i> in 1693, raz'd it to the
ground,<!--353.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
and by
the Treaty of <i>Nimeguen</i> it was stipulated that <i>Manheim</i> should be
demolished; which was done accordingly. <i>John-William</i> of <i>Newbourg</i>, the
last Elector, began again to fortify <i>Manheim</i>, according to the Plans
laid down by the famous <i>Cohorn</i>; but those Works were suspended, so that
no more than two Bastions and a Courtain were finish'd. When the present
Elector <i>Charles-Philip</i> came to live at <i>Manheim</i> he caus'd those Works
to be resumed which his Brother had discontinued, and to be carried on
with such Diligence that in a few Years he put the Place in a state of
Defence<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. The Fortifications are all fac'd with Brick; and <i>Manheim</i>
is now one of the best Places in all <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>This City has three fine Gates, of which that of the <i>Necker</i> is the most
magnificent, and the best adorned; in which one sees beautiful
Basso-relievos, after a Plan very happily executed. This Gate opens
towards a long and spacious Street, at the end of which stands the
Elector's Palace, one of the largest and most substantial Buildings in
<i>Europe</i>. It were to be wish'd indeed that the Architecture had been more
regular: Never had any Architect more Advantage, for he built it new from
the Foundation, was not stinted for want of room, and as he set no Limits
to his Expence, I should have thought that a masterly hand might have
produc'd something curious. Nevertheless there are Faults in the Building
which are shocking to such as have the least Skill in Architecture;
insomuch that they who have a Taste for that Science are sorry that a
Building which has been so expensive has been no better conducted. The
Situation of this Palace is indeed very fine, at the end of the City, and
of a very noble large Street, which like all the rest runs in a strait
Line. The Palace, which has a great
Square<!--354.png--><span class="pagenum">329</span>
before it, consists of a large
number of Lodging-Rooms, with a great high Pavilion in the middle, and two
advanc'd Wings, with ample Pavilions at the ends; where two other very
extensive Wings rise on both sides that are likewise terminated by
Pavilions, behind which there are other Lodging-Rooms. The inside of the
Palace is form'd by two great Courts, which are to be separated by an open
Gallery or Terrass, the Model of which is very much adorned with
Architecture; but I can't think it will look well when 'tis done. The
Apartments are adorn'd with fine noble Floors and Cielings, and have the
finest Prospect in the World to <i>Spire</i>, <i>Franckendahl</i>, <i>Worms</i>, and all
the Country in general, as far as the Mountains of <i>Alsace</i>, which
consists wholly of Towns and Villages. All this fine fruitful Country is
water'd by the <i>Rhine</i>, which passes behind the Palace of <i>Manheim</i>, and
washes its Fortifications. Upon this beautiful Canal there are to be the
Gardens of the Palace, for which there are intended two Courtains and a
Bastion.</p>

<p>'Tis almost inconceivable how the Elector was able to get all the Works
about <i>Manheim</i> finished in so few Years; for in short I remember to have
seen Partridges where there are now Houses and Palaces. The whole Town is
laid out in a most regular and charming manner; and 'tis without dispute
one of the prettiest Towns in <i>Europe</i>. 'Tis pity the Houses are not
higher: The reason they alledge for it is, that <i>Manheim</i> is a fortify'd
Town, and that by consequence the Houses ought to be low. I know not what
Authority there is for this, since <i>Strasbourg</i>, <i>Metz</i>, <i>Luxembourg</i>, and
<i>Lisle</i>, are Places of much more Importance than <i>Manheim</i>, and yet the
Houses are as high there as they are in other Towns.</p>

<p>The Palace is commodious, and yet, for what reason I know not, the Elector
does not
live<!--355.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
in it<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. Some say that he has been told of so many
Faults in it as have quite put him out of conceit with it, and others that
'tis because a certain Astrologer prophesy'd he would die there; but I am
apt to believe that the latter Reason is no more than a Joke, and I dare
to say that the Elector is too wise a Man to credit it. Mean time this
Prince dwells in a House belonging to a <i>Jew</i>, to which several other
private Houses are join'd; but for all that the Lodgings are very bad.</p>

<p>There can't be a better-natur'd Man than <i>Charles-Philip</i> of <i>Newbourg</i>,
Elector <i>Palatine</i>. He is the best of Masters, and the most affable of
Princes. He is reckoned extremely handsome, and one of the chief Dancers
in his time; and he has a noble Aspect. His Behaviour and Conversation
engage one to love him, and to pay one's court to him out of pure
Inclination. He formerly was fond of Pomp and Pleasure, but since the loss
of his only Daughter and his Son-in-law, who died within a few Years one
of another, he seems to be no longer taken with what was heretofore his
Amusement. The Elector has been twice marry'd, <i>viz.</i> first to
<i>Louisa-Charlotte</i> Princess of <i>Radzeville</i>, and secondly to <i>Theresa
Lubomirski</i>, both <i>Polish</i> Ladies. The former left him a Daughter that was
marry'd to <i>Joseph-Charles</i> Prince <i>Palatine</i> of <i>Sultzbach</i>, but died in
1728; as did her Husband the Year following. This Princess had such Beauty
and Merit, that she was the Comfort of her Father and the Admiration of
her Acquaintance. She left three young Princesses, whom the Elector causes
to be educated at his Court, where they are now all that he has to delight
him; but then they incessantly renew to him the sorrowful Remembrance of a
Daughter who was extremely dear to him.</p>

<!--356.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>The Death of that Princess has been a very great Affliction to the
Elector, and chang'd the Face of the <i>Palatine</i> Court. Indeed as to
Affability, and to the Goodness of his Temper, he is still the same
Elector, but he has no longer that Gaiety of Humour which his Daughter's
Company rais'd in him; for she had a thousand different Amusements for
him, and Pleasures and Merriment every where accompany'd her. The Elector
eats always in private, except on Holidays, and when there's any foreign
Prince at his Court. After he has been in public at Mass, he commonly
stops in one of his Apartments to chat with the Courtiers, or to play at
Billiards till Dinner-time. After Dinner he goes to Bed, and lies there
two Hours; then he rises, and after having caus'd himself to be dress'd,
he gives Audience to his Ministers, and to such private Persons as want to
talk with him. He is very attentive to those who speak to him, and answers
them with Good-nature and Kindness. He seldom refuses what is in his power
to grant; and when Reasons force him to a denial, 'tis visible that he is
uneasy, and he refuses in so civil a manner, that People go away at least
comforted, if not contented. At six o'clock in the Evening the whole Court
meets in his Electoral Highness's Apartment, where there is Play till nine
o'clock, and then the Elector retires, makes a very slight Supper, and
goes to Bed in good time.</p>

<p>Tho' the Elector dines in private there's always a Table sumptuously
serv'd for the hereditary Prince of <i>Sultzbach</i>, Brother to him who was
the Elector's Son-in-law. This passes for the Elector's Table, is spread
for eighteen Guests, and is serv'd by Pages.</p>

<p>The Prince <i>de Sultzbach</i> is look'd upon as the Elector's Heir, because
'tis not supposed that the Elector's Brother, the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>,
would<!--357.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
be willing to quit the first Electorate of the Empire, and the
great Benefices which he possesses, to become Elector <i>Palatine</i>, if he
should happen to survive his Brother<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. The Bishop of <i>Augsbourg</i>, the
Elector's second Brother, being a Priest, cannot succeed. The Prince <i>de
Sultzbach</i>'s Father is still living; but being as old as the Elector, he
is not like to survive him very long<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. The Prince <i>John-Christian</i> of
<i>Sultzbach</i> was born in 1700. He is the Widower of the Princess <i>de la
Tour</i> of <i>Auvergne</i>, who brought him for her Portion the Sovereignty of
<i>Bergopzoom</i>; and left him a Son, who is educated at <i>Brussels</i> with his
Great-Grandmother the Duchess Dowager of <i>Aremberg</i>. The Prince
<i>John-Christian</i> is tall and extremely corpulent, insomuch that 'tis well
if he has not the Dropsy. He spent the first Days of his Youth at the
Court of <i>Lorrain</i> in <i>France</i>, and in the <i>Netherlands</i>, by which Travels
he acquired a great deal of Politeness. He was lately betrothed to
<i>Eleonora-Philippina</i> of <i>Hesse-Rhinfelds</i>, Sister to the Princess of
<i>Piedmont</i><a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, and to the Duchess of <i>Bourbon</i>. This Princess is every
day expected from <i>Turin</i>, to which Place she accompanied her Sister.
Their Highnesses will then go and keep their Court at <i>Heidelberg</i><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<!--358.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>The Principal Noblemen of the <i>Palatine</i> Court are the following:</p>

<p><i>Francis-George</i> Count of <i>Manderscheldt-Blanckenheim</i><a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, the Steward
of the Houshold, Prime Minister, and Knight of the Order of St. <i>Hubert</i>.
He is of illustrious Extraction; is a Man of Integrity and very great
Probity, incapable of doing an ill thing, but not at all engaging in his
Deportment; for he is reserved, with an Air of Haughtiness, which is a
Defect that he was born with, and endeavours to conquer, but cannot. When
one knows him intimately he proves a good Friend, and capable of doing one
Service. He has very great Pensions from the Elector, and is the oldest of
his Family, which being pretty numerous, he does not live in a very grand
manner.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Sickingen</i> is Great Chamberlain, Minister of State, and
Knight of the Order of St. <i>Hubert</i>. He is a Gentleman of a fine Presence,
of an easy and engaging Access, with profound Learning, and Sentiments
suitable to his Birth. He was Governor of the late Prince <i>de Sultzbach</i>,
Son-in-law to the Elector; and he imprinted such Ideas of Men and Things
in the Mind of that young Prince, as gave great hopes that his Government
would be happy if ever he attain'd to it. M. <i>de Sickingen</i> was afterward
the Elector's Envoy Extraordinary to the Imperial Court; and I knew him at
<i>Vienna</i> where he was exceedingly beloved. At his return he succeeded his
Brother in the Office of Great Chamberlain, which he exercises with the
Approbation of the whole Court.</p>

<!--359.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p><i>John-Frederic</i> Count <i>de Globe</i>, is Grand Marshal, Minister of State, and
Knight of the Order of St. <i>Hubert</i>. He is very rich, and has a fine
Estate in <i>Bohemia</i>. He was once the Elector's Page, who finding him at
the bottom a Man of Integrity and Honour, took care of his Fortune, gave
him the best Employments at his Court, and raised him to the Dignity of
Count. M. <i>de Globe</i> has been seldom at <i>Manheim</i> for some Years past;
which is a Loss both to Court and City, because he liv'd very nobly, and
more than all, was very civil to Foreigners<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>The Baron <i>de Wohlin</i> is Master of the Horse<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. He is one of those Men
in whom we meet with that Candor and Probity so much boasted by our
Fathers.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de la Tour</i> and <i>Taxis</i> is Captain of the Life-Guards,
Lieutenant-General, and Knight of the Order of St. <i>Hubert</i>. His Carriage
seems blunt and proud, yet he is familiar with those that are in his
Confidence. He has considerable Credit at Court, owing to his Sister's
being so long in favour with the Elector.</p>

<p><i>Julius Augustus</i> Count <i>de la Marck</i>, Lieutenant-General, Captain of the
hundred <i>Swissers</i>, and Knight of St. <i>Hubert</i>, is descended of an
illustrious Family in the Empire. He spent part of his Youth in the
Service of <i>France</i>, where his eldest Brother is now actually a
Lieutenant-General, Colonel of a foreign Regiment, and a Commander of the
Order of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>. He has learnt all the <i>French</i> Politeness; his
<!--360.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>Behaviour
resembles the Man of Quality; his Temper is gay, and he loves
good Cheer, Joy and Pleasures.</p>

<p>The Count <i>Egmont de Hatzfeldt</i> Lieutenant-General, Minister of State, and
Secretary at War, comes from one of the best Families in the Empire, This
Nobleman is extraordinary civil; his House is open to all Persons of
Distinction; he lives very nobly, and both his Lady and himself are very
fond of entertaining Foreigners. They were both intrusted to conduct to
<i>Piedmont</i> the Princess of <i>Sultzbach</i> first Wife to <i>Charles</i> Prince of
<i>Piedmont</i><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, and discharged their Employments in such a manner that
they had the general Approbation of the <i>Sardinian</i> Court.</p>

<p>The Barons of <i>Hildesheim</i> and <i>Beveren</i> are both Ministers of State. The
former acquired a very great Reputation in the Negotiations that were
carry'd on at <i>Heidelberg</i> in 1719, for the Church of the <i>Calvinists</i>
which the Elector had a mind shou'd be Catholic. The second has been Envoy
to the King of <i>Great Britain</i>. They are both to be valued for their
Merit, live very honourably, and make Foreigners welcome.</p>

<p>I could tell you of many other Persons of Birth and Merit employ'd at this
Court, but really my Letter would be too tedious. Nevertheless I cannot
omit the mention of the Baron <i>d'Obsten</i>, whom you saw at <i>Breslau</i>, after
he had quitted the Service of the <i>Czar</i>. He is settled here, but has no
Character. He and all his Family are become of our Communion. He has a
considerable Pension from the Elector, and is generally very well
esteem'd. His Son, who is a Captain, is a young Gentleman of Merit, and
his Daughters are young Ladies highly to be esteem'd for their good
Behaviour and Politeness.</p>

<!--361.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>The Count <i>de Nassau-Weilbourg</i> lives here also. His Birth would engage me
to give you an Account of him tho' I were not induc'd to it by the
Consideration of his Merit. This Nobleman has an infinite share of it; he
is generous, magnificent, genteel, and civil, knowing what Family he is
descended from; but knowing it for no other reason than to discharge all
the Obligations of it. He is the Ornament of this Court, tho' he is not in
the Service of the Elector. His Father was Velt-Marshal, and Commander in
Chief of the <i>Palatine</i> Troops during the Reign of the late Elector <i>John
William</i>. The Count I am speaking of was Envoy Extraordinary from the
Elector to the Court of <i>France</i> during the Minority of <i>Lewis</i> XV. He
then went often to the Royal Palace to pay his court to the Regent's
Mother, and there it was that I knew him; for that Lady and the whole
Court of France had a very great Value for him. That Princess speaking of
him one day to me, said she was very glad that he was a Count of <i>Nassau</i>;
for indeed, said she, he deserves to bear a great Name<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>There are amiable People here of both Sexes who are very sociable, so that
'tis a Stranger's own fault if he misses of Amusement here; for such are
generally treated very civilly. As for my own part, I have received so
many Courtesies from the Elector, and so many Favours from his Court that
I shall for ever acknowledge them.</p>

<p>The Nobility maintain a Company of <i>French</i> Comedians who act three times
a Week upon a very little Theatre, but both the Townsmen and Foreigners
pay. Tho' this Company, of which the Count
<i>de</i><!--362.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
<i>la Marck</i> has the
Direction is not the best, yet 'tis a pleasure to go to it for the sake of
seeing Company. In the time of the late Princess there were a thousand
Pleasures which there are not now, so that her Death is still lamented.</p>

<p>The Elector's Revenues are reckon'd at two Millions of Crowns. You may
rate them more or less, 'tis no matter; for my own part, I affirm nothing,
being not willing to imitate the Marquis <i>de Breton-Villiers</i>, who in his
Memoirs of the Regency values the Revenues of all the Princes of the
Universe with as much assurance as if he had been Superintendant of every
one's Finances. The Elector has about 7 or 8000 Soldiers, exclusive of his
Guards. His best Places are <i>Manheim</i>, <i>Juliers</i>, and <i>Dusseldorp</i>. The
three Religions tolerated in the Empire have Churches here, and the <i>Jews</i>
a large Synagogue. They are very numerous at this Place, and two thirds of
the Houses belong to them, as being either built by them, or mortgag'd to
'em. Some of them are very rich, and drive a great Trade with the <i>Jews</i>
at <i>Meiz</i>, <i>Frankfort</i> and <i>Amsterdam</i>. 'Tis certain that they do a great
injury to the Christian Merchants, and that they are not honester here
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Don't write to me, if you please, before I have sent you my Direction,
because I know not whether I shall stay long enough at <i>Frankfort</i>, to
which some Affairs call me, to receive your Letters.</p>

<p>Just now we hear of the Death of Pope <i>Benedict</i> XIII. As I never saw a
Conclave, and am in the Humour of Travelling, I have an inclination to
take a tour to <i>Rome</i>. I shall not resolve on it till I come to
<i>Frankfort</i>. Which way soever I go you shall be inform'd, and I will not
fail to desire your Commands. Mean time I am always very sincerely, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>At my Departure from <i>Manheim</i> I pass'd the <i>Rhine</i> over a Bridge of
Boats, and in three Hours time arrived at <span class="smcap">Franckendahl</span>, which was formerly
fortified, but after having suffered by the general Conflagration in the
<i>Palatinate</i>, was dismantled by the Peace of <i>Nimeguen</i>, and so it has
remained ever since. It still bears the Marks of <i>French</i> Fury; and a
great many Houses that were burn'd have not been rebuilt.</p>

<p>There's the finest Country in the World between <i>Franckendahl</i> and <span class="smcap">Worms</span>.
I came hither at ten o'clock in the Morning, and spent the rest of the
Forenoon in seeing what was most remarkable. <i>Worms</i> is not the Place now
that it was before the <i>French</i> burn'd it. Its most wealthy Inhabitants
instead of rebuilding their Houses, retir'd to <i>Frankfort</i> and <i>Holland</i>,
so that the Chapter of <i>Worms</i>, which is wholly compos'd of Persons of
Quality, is now the chief Glory of the Town. The Bishop of it is the
Elector<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> of <i>Mentz</i>, who was chose <i>July</i> 12, 1694. This Prince has
built a new Episcopal Palace, the Contrivance
of<!--364.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
which is beautiful. It
joins to the Cathedral which is ancient, and built very substantially. The
<i>Lutherans</i> have just built a fine Church, the Roof of which is painted.
In several Compartiments there's the History of <i>Luther</i>'s pretended
Reformation. That Doctor is there represented as appearing before the Dyet
of the Empire which met at <i>Worms</i> <i>An.</i> 1521. You know that he was cited
to it by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. His Friends, to dissuade him from
appearing, put him in mind of <i>John Huss</i>, who notwithstanding the
Safe-Conduct that had been granted him by the Emperor <i>Sigismond</i>, was
burnt by a Decree of the Council of <i>Constance</i>. <i>Luther</i>, without being
intimidated, said, that <i>tho' he was sure to be engag'd with as many
Devils as there were Tiles upon the Houses of <span class="f">Worms</span>, he was resolv'd to
go</i>. He went thither accordingly, and appear'd the 17th of <i>April</i> before
the Dyet, where he offer'd, with a Courage deserving a better Cause, to
maintain his Doctrine and his Writings against all that should go about to
demolish them from the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Worms</i> stands in the middle of a fine spacious Plain,
abounding with Corn, Vineyards, and Fruit-Trees. A Wine is produced here
which is call'd <i>Lieben-Frauen-Milch</i>, i. e. <i>Our Lady's Milk</i>. The
<i>Rhine</i> is about three or four hundred Paces from the Town, but 'tis said
it formerly ran close by the Walls of it. Which way soever one comes to
<i>Worms</i>, one perceives at a great Distance the four Towers of the
Cathedral which are all built of red Freestone. Two drunken Fellows
mistook those Towers one day for Capuchin Fryars. Being in the Country at
a pretty good Distance from the Town, as the Sun was going down, one of
them said to his Comrade, <i>We have no Time to lose, the Gates are going to
be shut.&mdash;No matter</i>, said the other, pointing to the Towers; <i>Don't you
see those
Capuchins</i><!--365.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
<i>there before us? They are of the Town, and are
going thither as well as we. You are in the right</i>, reply'd the former,
<i>let us drink the good Fryar's Health</i>. They had a Gourd Bottle full of
Wine, of which they drank every Drop, so that they did not overtake the
imaginary Capuchins till next Day.</p>

<p>There is not a finer Country than that between <i>Worms</i> and <span class="smcap">Oppenheim</span>, a
little Town upon an Eminence, on the left Side of the <i>Rhine</i>, to which we
pass over a flying Bridge. The Road from <i>Oppenheim</i> is unpassable for
near two Leagues, because 'tis commonly overflown by that River; but
afterwards the Way is perfectly good to <i>Frankfort</i>. 'Twas very late when
I came to this City, but by good luck the People of <i>Frankfort</i> who
formerly shut their Gates at Sun-set have lately chose to keep them open
till ten o'clock, so that for paying a Trifle one may enter the Town.</p>

<p>I know not whether I need give any Account of the City of <span class="smcap">Frankfort</span>. It
has been so often describ'd, and is so well known to the World, that I
fancy every body knows what sort of Town it is, tho' they have not seen
it. <i>Frankfort</i> is famous for its two yearly Fairs, <i>viz.</i> at <i>Easter</i> and
<i>Michaelmas</i>. It suffer'd much by a great Fire in 1619, but the whole has
been since rebuilt, and the Houses are finer than before. There are few
Places upon the whole more disagreeable, and few Towns in <i>Germany</i> where
the Common People are more unpolish'd. The Burghers are not to be match'd
for Affectedness, and their Conversation is insupportable. The Magistrates
are all <i>Lutherans</i>; nevertheless the principal Churches belong to the
Catholics. The <i>Calvinists</i> may live in the Town, but cannot hold any
Employments, and are oblig'd to go for Worship to <i>Bockenheim</i> in the
County of <i>Hanau</i>, and to cause their Children to be baptiz'd in the
<i>Lutheran</i> Churches. The great Church in which the
Ceremony<!--366.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
of the
Emperor's Coronation is perform'd is dark, and by no means proper for such
an august Solemnity. You know that <i>Aix la Chapelle</i> is properly the Place
set apart for the Coronation of our Emperors, and <i>Frankfort</i> for their
Election. But since <i>Maximilian</i> I. no Emperor has been crown'd at <i>Aix</i>.
<i>Frankfort</i> being situate in the Centre of the Empire is much more
commodious for all the Princes, but particularly for the Spiritual
Electors and for the Elector Palatine, who may send for their Equipages by
Water and return them back by the same Convenience. When <i>Charles</i> VI. was
crown'd at <i>Frankfort</i> in 1711, there was an extraordinary Concourse of
Princes and Noblemen. Certain speculative Gentlemen made two Remarks on
this Occasion, from which they presag'd two Things. The one was, that the
Emperor made his Entrance into this City in close Mourning for the Emperor
<i>Joseph</i> his Brother; whereupon they said that <i>Charles</i> wore Mourning
because he foresaw that he should be the last Emperor of his Family. The
second was, that as <i>Charles</i> return'd from the Church invested with all
the Marks of Sovereignty, <i>Charlemain</i>'s Sword had like to have dropp'd
out of the Scabbard; which the Elector of <i>Triers</i> of the <i>Lorrain</i> Family
observing, catch'd hold of the Sword, and put it in again before it was
quite fallen out of the Scabbard. Upon this, the same Calculators of
Nativities said it was an Omen that the Emperor would never have a quiet
Reign, and that he would always be in a Situation that would oblige him to
draw his Sword for his Defence<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<!--367.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p>As to Persons of great Distinction at <i>Frankfort</i>, they are very few. The
Chief are the Princess-Dowager of <i>Nassau-Ousingen</i>, born Princess of
<i>Lovestein</i>; the Count <i>de Degenfeldt</i> (<i>Schomberg</i>)<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Major-General of
the King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Forces, and a Commander of the Order of the <i>Black
Eagle</i>; and finally, Madame <i>la Raugrave</i><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Daughter of <i>Charles-Lewis</i>
Elector Palatine: She is the last of the Blood of the Protestant
<i>Palatine</i> Princes. The Senate of <i>Frankfort</i>, in consideration of her
great Age, and in respect to her Birth, has granted her the Liberty of
keeping a <i>Calvinist</i> Chaplain to preach in her own House. Sometimes the
Prince <i>de la Tour</i> and <i>Taxis</i><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Hereditary Post-Master of the Empire
resides at <i>Frankfort</i>. His House is a great Relief to Foreigners. His
Princess<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> is a Lady of very great Merit, and has the Soul and
Sentiments of a Queen. In the Houses of the Persons that I have mention'd
there's an Assembly of both Sexes every Evening; but take them one with
another they are very thin except at the Fairs, when there's a vast Resort
of Nobility and Gentry. Most of the Electors and Princes of the Empire
have their Agents at <i>Frankfort</i>, to whom they give the Title of
Residents; but those Gentlemen are not a jot the more respected for it,
most of them being Merchants of the City of <i>Frankfort</i> it self, who
sollicit the Title in order to be exempt from the Authority of the Senate,
and from the Payment of the Customs, and to qualify
themselves<!--368.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
to place
over their Doors the Arms of the Princes to whom they send the
News-papers.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Degenfeldt</i> makes such a Figure here that he deserves a more
particular mention. He is a Nobleman of good Extraction. He is a Native of
the <i>Palatinate</i>, and spent his Youth in the Service of the Elector
Palatine. He was at that Time a <i>Calvinist</i>, but turn'd Catholic. Some
Years after, he was reconcil'd to his former Communion, and married in
<i>England</i> a Cousin of his, the Daughter of the Duke <i>de Schomberg</i>, with
whom he had a very great Estate. He has also a considerable Expectancy
from Madame <i>la Raugrave</i> a <i>Palatine</i>, his Aunt<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. The Relation of M.
<i>de Degenfeldt</i> to this Lady, brings to my Mind the History of the Mother
of Madame <i>la Raugrave</i>, who as I have observ'd was a <i>Degenfeldt</i>. I have
chose to give it you from what was told me by the late Madame of <i>France</i>,
and from very good Memoirs that have been put into my hands. I have plac'd
this History as a Transaction in the Time of the ancient <i>Germans</i>; and as
I design'd to insert it in a Work which I have undertaken, for want of
something else to employ my Time, I chuse to do it by way of a Discourse
from Madame the late Electress of <i>Hanover</i> to her Daughter-in-law. I
herewith send you the entire History, and at the End of it you will find
the Key. As I fancy you are quite disengag'd in the Country, I don't
apprehend that the reading of it will be Loss of your Time. I rather fear
you won't like it; but in either case 'twill be your own Fault; I don't
force you to read; you may if you please let <i>Gertrude</i> alone.</p>

<h3><i>History of GERTRUDE a <span class="f">Marcoman</span> Lady.</i></h3>

<p>The History of <i>Gertrude</i>, of which I propose to give you, my Princess, a
Relation, is properly the History of the Extinction of my Family; for the
fatal Passion of my Brother King <i>Malcolm</i> for that Lady, is in all
appearance the Reason that there are no more left in my Family than three
Princesses<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, and my self.</p>

<p>There was such a Harmony in Sentiments betwixt my Brother and me, that it
united us in the strictest Friendship. We had been brought up together in
<i>Belgium</i><a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, where the King my Father had been oblig'd to take refuge,
that he might be nearer at hand to receive Succours from <i>Alfred</i> King of
<i>Albion</i>, Father of the Queen my Mother, against the <i>Romans</i>, who after a
long and bloody War had turn'd him out of his Dominions. That King amus'd
him a long while with fair Promises; but the Misunderstanding which there
was at that time between him and the States of his Kingdom, added to a
certain Indolence in his natural Temper, hinder'd him from seeing the
Effect of them; and the King my Father did not live long enough to be
witness of the Peace which the <i>Romans</i> were at length oblig'd by his
Allies to conclude. This was not an advantageous Peace for <i>Malcolm</i> my
Brother, because in order to obtain it he was oblig'd to yield a part of
his Dominions to the Prince of the<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a><i>Boyens</i>, an Ally of the <i>Romans</i>,
and upon these Terms he was left in quiet possession of the rest.</p>

<!--370.png--><p><span class="pagenum">345</span></p>

<p>When my Brother saw himself establish'd on the Throne, he thought of
marrying. His Ministers propos'd the Princess of the <i>Catti</i> as the
fittest Match for him, and assur'd him that besides her illustrious
Extraction he could not marry a more beautiful Princess, or one of a
better Temper. My Brother who only alter'd his Condition for Reasons of
State, was willing enough to follow their Advice, and accordingly espous'd
her. The Marriage at first prov'd very happy; the Queen his Wife had her
share of Beauty, and tho' her Temper was very different from what it had
been represented to my Brother, yet she so cunningly disguis'd it for some
time that this Prince thought himself very happy in his Choice. But their
Agreement was of a short Duration; the Queen's true Humour soon discover'd
it self: It appear'd that she was ill-natur'd, and intolerably
high-spirited; of an odd sullen Temper, always ready to contradict, and
frequently subject to Chagrin, of which she herself knew not the Cause,
and which she vented upon all that approach'd her without distinction. The
King my Brother was of a Temper quite the reverse: He lov'd Diversions,
was civil, affable, naturally gay, beneficent; and I don't speak it out of
Partiality in favour of a Brother whose Memory is still dear to me, but
I'll be bold to say, that if he had not been quite so choleric, he would
have been the most accomplish'd Prince of his Time. Nevertheless he bore
with his Wife's ill Humours very patiently at first, and endeavour'd to
reclaim her by gentle Usage; but when he saw that all the Pains he took
were to no purpose, he resolv'd at length to seek out some other
Amusement.</p>

<p>The Beauty of <i>Gertrude</i>, Maid of Honour to the Queen his Wife, had for a
long time smitten him, but hitherto he had only discover'd his Passion to
her by his Glances, for fear of disgusting the
Queen.<!--371.png--><span class="pagenum">346</span>
<i>Gertrude</i> who
perceiv'd that my Brother did not look upon her with Indifference,
affected to shun every Opportunity that Prince might take of revealing his
Love to her. But Fortune favour'd my Brother, who being one day with his
Queen in her Apartment, when the Discourse fell upon Jewels, perceiv'd
that the Princess had left off wearing a certain Bracelet of which he had
made her a Present, and asking her what she had done with it, the Queen
told him that she believ'd she had laid it up in a Casket of which she had
the Key in her Pocket. She made one of her Maids fetch it, and open'd it,
but the Bracelet was not there, at which she seem'd uneasy. This my
Brother observ'd, and taking a Pleasure in making her more uneasy, he said
to her, tho' in a manner that shew'd he did not think as he spoke, that
she had undoubtedly some Gallant in a Corner, to whom she had either given
that Bracelet, or who had stole it from her. These Words, tho' deliver'd
in jest, made a deep Impression upon the Queen, and as it was her Nature
soon to take fire, she was stung to the quick at what he had said, and
forgetting the Respect she ow'd to the King her Husband, was in such a
Passion with him that she let fall some Words that were very affronting.
My Brother who was naturally mettlesome and fiery, and far from expecting
any such Treatment, made her answer, that if she continued to forget
herself after that manner, he would find ways and means to humble her.
Upon this he went out of the Room abruptly, and passing through the
Antichamber, met the fair <i>Gertrude</i>. Such was his Disgust that instead of
being upon the reserve as he had been, he had a long Conversation with
her, and found her so sprightly and good-natur'd that he was compleatly
charm'd with her. He declar'd his Love to her, and she was so artful that
<!--372.png--><span class="pagenum">347</span>tho'
she gave him no Hopes, yet she did not rebuff him.</p>

<p>When my Brother was retir'd, <i>Gertrude</i> went into the Apartment of the
Queen her Mistress, who plac'd her whole Confidence in her. That Princess
no sooner saw her but she made a thousand Complaints of the King's
Treatment of her. <i>Gertrude</i> seem'd to sympathize in her Resentment, and
believing that the Queen could not fail to know that the King had talk'd
with her in the Antichamber, she told her that the Prince having met her
in her Passage gave her an angry Account of what had passed; and that she
had done all she could to pacify him, but to no purpose: At the same time
she blam'd the King's Proceeding; and encourag'd by the Liberty which the
Queen gave her, told her that if she who was but a private Gentlewoman was
so treated by any Husband, she would never pardon him tho' he were a King.
She added several other Sayings which instead of pacifying this silly
Queen, did but exasperate her the more.</p>

<p>In the mean time, <i>Malcolm</i>, who was impatient to know the Success of his
Amour, wrote a Letter to <i>Gertrude</i> which he sent her by one of his chief
Domestics, together with a rich Diamond Equipage. But the artful
<i>Gertrude</i> whose Aim was to draw on his Passion, rather than to gratify
it, was far from yielding to his first Attacks, and sent him back the
Diamonds, tho' with a modest and respectful Answer, wherein she desir'd
him to talk no more to her of Love. My Brother was too deeply smitten to
be repuls'd; he doubled his Presents, was assiduous, and eager in his
Courtship; and as 'tis very rare for a King of his amiable Personage to
meet with long Resistance, <i>Gertrude</i> abated of her Shyness by degrees,
and at length discovered that she was not insensible of Love. Their
Correspondence which did not exceed the Bounds of Honour,
was<!--373.png--><span class="pagenum">348</span>
kept secret
for a considerable time, but made the greater Blaze when it was known.
<i>Malcolm</i> being one day with his Wife, happen'd, without perceiving it, to
drop a Letter which the Queen took up, and found to be the Hand-writing of
<i>Gertrude</i>. The Letter being written in <i>Latin</i> made the Queen the more
curious to know what was in it; and she gave it to her Cousin, Prince
<i>Valamir</i>, desiring him to unfold the Contents of it to her. This Prince
was so unwise as to satisfy her Curiosity, and acquainted her that
<i>Gertrude</i> by this Letter assur'd the King that he had gain'd her Heart.
You will easily imagine how much the Queen was ruffled when she heard of
this Intrigue: She could not contain herself; and without giving ear to
the Arguments made use of by <i>Valamir</i>, she ran immediately to
<i>Gertrude</i>'s Apartment in the Palace, who by good luck was gone abroad.
The Queen thinking her Casket was in <i>Gertrude</i>'s Closet caused it to be
broke open, and finding it there, open'd it, and took out all the Letters,
of which several that appear'd to be from the King her Husband left her no
room to doubt of that Prince's extraordinary Passion for <i>Gertrude</i>, and
of the Intimacy there was between them. My Brother was quickly inform'd of
what the Queen had been doing, but conceal'd his Uneasiness, shew'd his
Wife no manner of Resentment, and only sent a Caution to <i>Gertrude</i> not to
return to the Palace. <i>Malcolm</i>'s Silence deceiv'd the Queen, who indeed
was not a Lady of very great Penetration, so that she flatter'd herself
the King might possibly be ignorant of the Outrage she had committed; and
upon this Supposition she thought it her best way to dissemble her Hatred
and Wrath against <i>Gertrude</i>. She pretended therefore to be very uneasy
for fear of what had happen'd to her, caus'd a Search to be made for her
several days, and seem'd very much dejected at
her<!--374.png--><span class="pagenum">349</span>
Absence. She hoped by
all these Demonstrations of Friendship to decoy her back to the Palace, in
order then to be compleatly reveng'd of her.</p>

<p>Thus Matters stood when the King of the <i>Suevi</i>, the Brother-in-law of the
Queen my Sister-in-law, came to Court with the Queen his Wife. This Prince
having observ'd the Queen's Melancholy on several occasions, ask'd her the
reason of it one day as they sate at Table. 'You must not be surpriz'd,
said <i>Malcolm</i>, to see the Queen my Wife out of temper; 'tis her common
Infirmity, and very often she her self knows not the cause of it. My
Ailment is but too real (reply'd the Queen in a great Pet;) and (then
addressing herself to her Husband) said she, it does not at all become you
whose dishonourable Amours have been the only Cause of my Disorder, to
insinuate as if it were but imaginary.' This Answer made in so public a
manner, so nettled my Brother that he turn'd pale for meer Vexation, and
not being able to curb his Passion, forgot his Dignity so far as to strike
her; upon which the unfortunate Princess rose from Table, and retir'd in
Tears to her own Apartment. My Brother, whose Passion was always as soon
over as it was easily kindled, was sorry in a very few moments after for
what he had done, made his Excuses to the King and Queen of the <i>Suevi</i>,
and rising from Table, went with them to his Wife's Apartment, where he
ask'd her pardon for what had pass'd. This Atonement, which the Queen did
not expect so soon, touch'd her to the quick: The King and she embrac'd
each other, and exchang'd their Promises to forget as well as to forgive
every Offence. But would you believe it? that fickle, fantastical Creature
my Sister-in-law chang'd her mind all on a sudden, and when her Husband
came in the Evening with an intention to spend the Night with her, she
absolutely refus'd to let him bed with her unless
he<!--375.png--><span class="pagenum">350</span>
would resolve to
deliver up <i>Gertrude</i> to her. <i>Malcolm</i>, who was still asham'd at what he
had done in his last Fury, receiv'd so violent a Proposition with more
Patience than he would have done upon another Occasion. He endeavour'd by
fair Words to pacify his Wife, assuring her that nothing criminal had ever
pass'd between him and <i>Gertrude</i>, and that tho' he had corresponded with
the Girl by Letters, it was not out of any Love he had for her, so much as
to know whether it was true that she wrote as good <i>Latin</i> as he had been
told she did. Tho' this Speech of his was not very probable, yet as People
are easily inclin'd to believe what they wish to be true, the Queen
suffer'd herself to be at last persuaded, and was reconciled to her
Husband without insisting any farther on the Sacrifice she at first
demanded.</p>

<p>The Emperor being come to spend some Time at <i>Pluibourg</i>, summon'd an
Assembly thither of the Princes of the Empire. My Brother went thither
with the Queen his Wife; but the Consequence was that they were more
embroil'd than ever; and my Sister-in-law was so unadvised as to let
<i>Cæsar</i> and his Court be Witnesses of certain Brawls, which for her own
Interest as well as her Husband's, she ought to have carefully confin'd
within the Limits of her own Houshold. 'Tis true that my Brother had no
very great Respect for her, and he lov'd <i>Gertrude</i> more than ever. Being
hindred by a slight Indisposition from going to <i>Montpayen</i> where he kept
her at one of his Houses, not a Day pass'd but he sent an Express to know
how she did, and the Queen's ill Temper, who no doubt had better have
try'd good-natur'd Methods to reclaim him, only incens'd him against her,
and made him the fonder of <i>Gertrude</i>.</p>

<p>The Assembly of the Princes of <i>Germany</i> being over, and the Emperor
return'd to <i>Rome</i>, my
Brother<!--376.png--><span class="pagenum">351</span>
set out for <i>Montpayen</i> the Capital of his
Kingdom, and gave orders for his Queen to follow him next Day. But for a
Reason which I never could dive into, the Princess instead of obeying him
stay'd a Month longer at <i>Pluibourg</i>, without vouchsafing to let the King
her Husband know the Reason of her delay; and not only so, but when she
came to <i>Montpayen</i>, she had the Assurance to go with a bold Face to her
Husband's Apartment, without knowing how he would take it: But the Prince
who had just Reason to be angry, foreseeing that she was like enough to
take such a step, had given orders to refuse her Entrance; wherefore she
was oblig'd to retire to her Apartment, whither a Captain of the Guards
came in a Moment after, to tell her from the King that she was a Prisoner.</p>

<p>This unhappy Princess bore her Disgrace very weakly. She repented, but too
late, of having been so imprudent as to contravene the Orders of the King
her Husband; and hoping to work upon his Good-nature, she wrote him a most
submissive Letter, begging his pardon for her Disobedience, and intreating
him to restore her to her Liberty. My Brother sent her an Answer, wherein
he only gave her the Title of the Princess of <i>Cattia</i>. He told her, 'that
having consider'd the Disagreement there was betwixt his Temper and her's,
he resolved to be divorc'd from her, and that she would do well herself to
give her Consent to it; which if she did with a good Grace, he would
restore her to her Liberty and settle a Revenue on her suitable to her
Rank.'</p>

<p>This Answer was a Thunder-stroke to my Sister-in-law; she rav'd and tore
like a mad Woman. She was for a long while like one out of her Senses, but
recovering them at length by the help of her Women, and consulting with
those that had the greatest share of her Confidence, she sent the King
<!--377.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>word
that he was Master, and might make use of his Authority, but that
she would never consent to the Divorce.</p>

<p>My Brother who had fix'd his Resolution, and saw no other way to get
possession of <i>Gertrude</i> than by marrying that Girl who had presum'd to
set so high a Price upon her Favours, took off the Mask, notify'd his
Design to the Court, and in a few days after, the Marriage was perform'd
in the manner that you know is practis'd in <i>Germany</i> by Princes who marry
beneath themselves, which excludes the Children by such <i>Venter</i> from
succeeding to the Father's Estate. As soon as he was marry'd, he restor'd
the Queen to her Liberty, and acquainted her, 'That by the Advice and
Consent of the Priests of his Kingdom whom he had caused to be assembled,
he had marry'd <i>Gertrude</i>. That the Thing being done and past remedy, he
hoped she would resolve to make her self easy. That however, he would
always treat her as a Princess; that she should be welcome to continue in
her Apartment at the Palace; that she should have her Guards to attend
her, and that he had set apart a sufficient Fund for her Maintenance; but
that he expected she would be so complaisant as to acknowledge <i>Gertrude</i>
hereafter for the lawful Queen.'</p>

<p>My Sister-in-law who then saw that her Disgrace was infallible, gave her
self up to Complaints and Tears, wrote to the King her Husband in the most
moving Language, and implor'd the assistance of the King her Brother: But
all was to no purpose; she was oblig'd to submit to her Misfortune, and to
be patient under an Affliction which she had partly brought upon her self
by her Folly.</p>

<p>While all this pass'd, my Brother was at one of his Seats not far<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
from his Capital, where he
caus'd<!--378.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
<i>Gertrude</i> to be treated as a Queen,
and not long after carried her to <i>Montpayen</i> where the sight of her
Royalty was a fresh Mortification to the Queen my Sister-in-law. However,
the unfortunate Princess not yet despairing of the means of reclaiming her
Husband, was resolv'd to make the last Attempt to turn that Prince's
Heart. She dress'd herself in the most gay and rich Apparel that she could
get, and taking her Children along with her, went to meet the King her
Husband in the Room next to the Hall where he was at Table with
<i>Gertrude</i>, and thro' which he must necessarily return. When he appear'd,
she threw herself with her Children at his Feet, clasp'd his Knees,
conjur'd him with Tears in her Eyes to look with Pity on an unhappy
Princess whom he had formerly thought fit to make his Wife, and to
consider that the Affront he put upon her by divorcing her, would be a
Reproach to those very Children of whom he had been so fond. My Brother
seem'd to be melted at so moving a Spectacle, look'd for some Moments on
his Wife and Children with Tears in his Eyes, and he was just ready to
raise her from the Ground, when <i>Gertrude</i> who was at his Heels, fearing
what might be the Consequence of the Confusion that she saw him in, talk'd
earnestly to him in the <i>Tuscan</i> Language, saying, <i>Remember</i>, my Lord,
<i>what you promis'd me</i>. These few Words wrought so much on the unsteady
Mind of my Brother that he only lifted up his Hands to Heaven and went on,
shewing by the Trouble he was under, how little he was Master of his
Reason upon this Occasion. The Queen my Sister-in-law remain'd for a while
speechless, but Fury and Despair quickly seiz'd her Soul. She rose up and
ran into her Closet, where snatching up a Dagger<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> she came back again
with an
Intention<!--379.png--><span class="pagenum">354</span>
to stick it into her Rival's Heart. But the Rage she
was in having so confounded her that she had not a Thought of concealing
that Instrument of her Revenge, it was perceiv'd by one of the chief
Courtiers who pluck'd it from her just as she was going into the Closet
where my Brother was with <i>Gertrude</i>. That Prince hearing a Noise so near
him ran out, and demanded what was the matter. 'Tis I, (said the Queen
very couragiously) 'who was coming to revenge my self and you too on the
Monster which disunites us; but that Traytor there (said she, pointing to
the Man that had wrested the Dagger out of her Hands) has depriv'd me of
the only Opportunity that I could call a Pleasure.&mdash;Princess, (said the
King to her very calmly) don't indulge your self any longer in such
extravagant Passions, if you are unwilling that I should use you roughly.'
Then he retir'd with <i>Gertrude</i>, and my Sister-in-law return'd to her
Apartment in a Temper which you may easily imagine.</p>

<p><i>Clodius</i>, who now governs the Empire, being at that time proclaim'd
Emperor, this Princess made her Complaints to him, and desir'd him to
reconcile <i>Malcolm</i> to her. But <i>Cæsar</i> having excus'd himself, my
Sister-in-law who could no longer bear the Presence of her Rival, retir'd
to the King her Brother, there to wait the End of her Misfortunes. My
Brother liv'd afterwards very lovingly with his new Spouse, and had by her
four Sons and as many Daughters. But Death having at last robb'd him of a
Person so dear to him, the Prince was so afflicted for the Loss of her,
that he spent two Years in continual Sorrow, and at length himself paid
the same Tribute to Nature.</p>

<!--380.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>He left but one Son and a Daughter by his lawful Spouse who surviv'd him
some Years. The King my Nephew was marry'd, but he was of such a
melancholy Temper, his Humour was so different from the Queen's, and there
was so little Love betwixt them, that he died without Issue. With him I
have seen my Family utterly extinct, its Dominions transferr'd to the
Power of a Prince who is hardly related to us, and my Country abandon'd to
the most dismal Desolation. For my Niece having marry'd <i>Meroveus</i>,
Brother to <i>Ariovisto</i> King of the <i>Gauls</i>, the latter who is an ambitious
Prince and goes to War upon every the least Pretence, asserted the Rights
of his Sister-in-law without Delay, and pleading that she ought to succeed
to the Inheritance of the King her Brother, notwithstanding the <i>Salic</i>
Law establish'd in <i>Germany</i>, he sent a formidable Army into the Dominions
of my deceased Nephew, where the <i>Gauls</i> at first meeting with no
Resistance, committed enormous Cruelties, and extended their Fury even to
the Violation of the Tomb of the Kings my Ancestors, whose dead Bodies
were stripp'd and exposed to the Caprice of the unruly Soldiers:
Calamities, which perhaps would never have happen'd, had it not been for
my Brother's fatal Passion for <i>Gertrude</i>; because in all Appearance if he
had liv'd in a good Understanding with his lawful Spouse; he would have
had more Children by her, and I would not have had the Vexation to see the
Throne of my Fathers posses'd by a foreign Family.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Munich, April</i> 2, 1730.</span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>Since you received my last I have done and seen a great many Things. On
the 23d of <i>March</i> I set out from <i>Frankfort</i> for <span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, the Capital
of the upper County of <i>Catzenellenbogen</i>, and the Residence of
<i>Ernest-Lewis</i> Landgrave of <i>Hesse-Darmstadt</i><a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

<p>This Town is extremely small, and only enclosed with Pallisadoes. If the
Prince's Palace had been finish'd according to its Model, it would have
been one of the greatest and most magnificent in <i>Europe</i>, and there might
have been Lodgings for the Emperor, and all the nine Electors of the
Empire. It would have been bigger than the Town, and
have<!--383.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
cost immense
Sums: That Part which is finish'd makes a very grand Appearance. But all
those magnificent Works which the Landgrave Regent at first carried on
with very great Vigour are entirely discontinu'd, and there's no
Appearance that they will ever be taken in hand again. The old Palace is
much more commodious than it seems to be; its Apartments being convenient,
and richly furnish'd. The Landgrave does not live in the Palace, but leads
a very retir'd Life in a little House upon the Square, where he is never
seen but upon Sundays and Holidays. He amuses himself in turning of Ivory,
making Chymical Experiments, and in Drawing. He loves Hunting above all
things whatsoever. He delights in Agriculture, and in Music, and it may
strictly be said that he is never unemploy'd. He has very great Knowledge
natural and acquir'd. He has seen a great many Countries, and tho' sixty
Years of Age he still looks well, and his grey Hairs, not to call them
white, give him a venerable Air. He sits a Horse very well, walks well,
and seems to enjoy perfect Health. His Wife was <i>Dorothy</i> of
<i>Brandenbourg-Onoltzbach</i>, who died in 1705. They say that he lately
married <i>N&mdash;&mdash; de Spiegel</i> the Widow of Count <i>Seibelsdorf</i> a
Lieutenant-General in the Service of <i>Bavaria</i>. Be that as it will, the
Marriage is not public, and the Lady still goes by the Name of her former
Husband by whom she has Children. 'Tis true that the Landgrave pays her
very great Distinction, and indeed she is very amiable.</p>

<p>This Prince commonly dines at a little Table spread only for four People;
but on Sundays and Holidays he goes to the Palace, and dines with his Son
at a Table cover'd for sixteen Guests, and sups with the Ladies who are
never seen at Court but upon those Days. 'Tis a very hard matter to come
at the Speech of the Landgrave, and much
more<!--384.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
to that of his only Son the
hereditary Prince. The Hunting-Officers are the only Persons that have the
Privilege of Access to them; for which reason this is not one of the most
entertaining Courts; and a Man is under a necessity of throwing himself
into the Town, where indeed there are a great many People of Merit who are
civil to Foreigners.</p>

<p>The hereditary Prince <i>Lewis</i>, the only Son of the Landgrave, who was born
the 5th of <i>April</i> 1691, is a handsome Man, has a noble Air, dances well,
mounts a Horse well, has Vivacity, Spirit, and Politeness, but is often
thoughtful, melancholy, and goes for Retirement to the Woods, where he is
passionately fond of Hunting; but is apt to create himself Uneasiness, and
does not know how to dissemble it. Tho' he has all the Qualities necessary
to shine in Company, yet he sees but very little. He married
<i>Charlotta-Christina of Hanau</i>, who dying in 1726, left him three Sons and
two Daughters, the eldest of which was then seven Years of Age. By virtue
of this Marriage the Prince is Heir to the Count of <i>Hanau's</i> Estate in
<i>Alsace</i>, and to all his Freeholds in general, which will be a very rich
Succession.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Court of <i>Darmstadt</i> is very numerous. The Landgrave has
a great many Counsellors of State, Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber and Court,
and a greater Number still of Officers of the Venery, and Huntsmen. There
is not a Province in <i>Germany</i> more proper for Hunting, nor in <i>Europe</i>
where there are more Deer. 'Tis a flat even Country, and a gravelly Soil
interspersed with Woods thro' which there are cut noble Roads. I have seen
the Deer come up close to the Pallisadoes of the Town, and at their
Rutting-time I have heard them cry as I lay in my Bed. This great plenty
of Deer is extremely troublesome to the Peasants who are abroad day and
night to watch their Fields.
The<!--385.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Landgrave and the hereditary Prince are
so jealous of their Game that they reckon it as bad a Crime as Murder for
any one to kill a Deer; and tho' 'tis an establish'd Custom among almost
all Sovereigns to punish with Severity all those that kill a Creature
which God however certainly created for the Use of all Mankind, yet there
is no Prince who observes this Law more strictly than the Landgrave.</p>

<p>I cannot give you a more certain Account of the Revenues of this Prince
than of those of all the other Sovereigns. 'Tis said that he has 5 or
600000 Florins <i>per Ann.</i> I am not very well inform'd of the number of his
Troops, for I have only seen his Regiment of Guards which is in very
compleat Order. His Horse-Guards are also very fine Troops, and commanded
by the General <i>Miltitz</i>, who is at the same time Grand Marshal of the
Court, the Honours of which he performs in a very handsome manner.</p>

<p>Tho' the Soil at <i>Darmstadt</i> is very gravelly, it produces excellent
Pulse. I have seen Asparagus at the Landgrave's Table, three of which
weigh'd a Pound, tho' indeed they were not altogether so nice. I remember
that in a former Journey which I made hither in the Month of <i>December</i>,
there were brought to the Landgrave in several Pots of Porcellain, a Dwarf
Cherry-Tree laden with Cherries; Strawberry-Plants, an Almond-Tree, and in
short, the Fruits of all the Seasons.</p>

<p>The intended Hunting-Match, for what reason I know not, was put off; and
as I came hither only to see it, I staid but one Day and went to <span class="smcap">Hanau</span>.
The Count and the Princess of <i>Hanau</i> were but lately return'd from
<i>Alsace</i>. The Town of <i>Hanau</i> is situate on a large Plain to the right of
the <i>Main</i>. 'Tis divided into two Wards, the old and the new Town: The
latter is much bigger than the former: It was built by the <i>Walloon</i>
Protestants, who,
during<!--386.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
the Duke of <i>Alva's</i> Persecution under <i>Philip</i>
II. King of <i>Spain</i>, quitted the <i>Netherlands</i> and came to settle at
<i>Hanau</i>, which they fortify'd, and built in such a manner that all the
Streets run parallel. The Count keeps several Companies in pay, from which
he makes Detachments for the Quota he is oblig'd to furnish, as a Member
of the Circle of the <i>Upper Rhine</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Walloons</i> who are settled at <i>Hanau</i> have established several
Manufactures there, especially Woollen Stuffs. The <i>Calvinists</i>, the
<i>Lutherans</i>, and the <i>Jews</i> are tolerated here, and as for us Catholics,
we may go to Mass where we please.</p>

<p>The Count's Palace is in the old Town: 'Tis an ancient Building, and makes
no great Appearance, but the Apartments are commodious, and very richly
furnish'd. The Count has a very pretty Pleasure-House a quarter of a
League from <i>Hanau</i>, call'd <span class="smcap">Philipsruhe</span>, <i>i. e.</i> (<i>Philip's Repose</i>) and
built by the late Count <i>de Hanau</i>, Brother to the Count Regent<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.
'Twas at this Seat that I found the Count of <i>Hanau</i>. There was a very
numerous Attendance, and I heartily wish'd I could have staid there a few
days. Few Princes in the Empire live more elegantly than the Count <i>de
Hanau</i>. The Lady who directs the whole Houshold, and keeps all things in
wonderful Order is the Princess<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> who is of the Family of
<i>Brandenbourg-Anspach</i>, and Sister to the Queen of <i>England</i>. At this
Court you have all the Liberty than can be desired. When you first come a
Chamber is provided for your Lodging, and a Footman order'd to wait on
you. Every Morning an Officer comes to know what you will please to have
for Breakfast; and there's every Thing to be had that you call for. If
afterwards you have a mind to go out a Hunting, you send to the Great
Huntsman<!--387.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
for a Guide and to the Count for Horses out of his Stables. If
you come back too late for Dinner at Court, you are serv'd very elegantly
in your own Apartment. In the Evening when you are retir'd from Company, a
Butler takes care to provide you with Wine and Beer. The Servants of
Foreigners diet with those of the Count. His own Table which is commonly
for eighteen Guests is served as well as most, and a second Table is
serv'd with the same Magnificence. The Count has a very great Family, and
lives every way like a Prince; and indeed 'tis his own Fault that he is
not one, for he has had the Imperial Diploma for it a long while, but he
does not care to make use of it; saying, he had rather be the first Count
than the lowest Prince. He is the last Male of his Family. After his Death
the County of <i>Hanau</i> relapses to the Landgrave of <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>,
according to the Treaty of Confraternity made between the several Families
of <i>Saxony</i>, <i>Hesse</i>, and <i>Hanau</i>, which imports that the said Families
shall succeed one another. The King of <i>Poland</i> as Elector of <i>Saxony</i>
ought to have had his Share in the Succession to the County of <i>Hanau</i>,
but his Majesty by a Treaty yielded his Rights to the Landgrave of
<i>Cassel</i>. As to the Lands in <i>Alsace</i>, and the Freeholds, they revert, as
I told you before, to the Children of the hereditary Prince of
<i>Darmstadt</i>.</p>

<p>The Count of <i>Hanau</i> seems to be much older than he is in reality. He is a
very civil Nobleman, and Hunting is a Diversion of which he is extremely
fond, so that to kill a Deer upon his Lands is an unpardonable Crime; and
the lesser Game, such as Rabbits, Hares, and Partridges, are equally his
Care. All these Creatures spoil the Fields; but they serve for the Count's
Amusement, while the poor Peasant is oblig'd to pay his Tax, and dares not
speak a Word.</p>

<!--388.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p>From <i>Hanau</i> to <span class="smcap">Munich</span> I never made a stop; but after having travell'd
thro' <i>Wurtzbourg</i>, <i>Nurembourg</i>, and <i>Augsbourg</i> arrived here last night,
and propose to set out again to-morrow, and after two or three days stay
at <i>Saltzbourg</i> shall proceed by the way of <i>Tirol</i> to <i>Venice</i>, where I
beg you would not fail to let me hear from you.</p>

<p>I am just come from attending the Obsequies of <i>Theresa-Cunegunda
Sobieski</i> Electoress of <i>Bavaria</i>, Mother to the Elector. This Princess
died lately at <i>Venice</i>, to which City she retir'd eighteen Months ago,
and her Corpse is forthwith expected to be interr'd in the Tomb of the
Electoral Family. She has left, as 'tis said, near six millions of
Florins, which, since she has made no Will, are to be equally shar'd
between the four Princes her Sons. She has moreover left a Daughter who is
a Nun in a Convent of this City. In 1719, when she took the Habit, I was
present. She chose this retir'd Life against the Will of her Father the
Elector, who did all he could to dissuade her from it; and she liv'd in
great Reputation for her Piety. But to return to the Obsequies of the
Electoress: The Elector and Electoress assisted at them, together with the
Elector of <i>Cologne</i>, the Duke <i>Ferdinand</i>, the Bishop of <i>Freisingen</i>,
the Duchess <i>Ferdinand</i>, and the two Princes her Sons. These Princes had
Cowls upon their Heads, and great Cloaks, which is not one of the most
becoming Dresses. The Family of <i>Bavaria</i> observes a very singular Custom,
which is, never to give a black Livery, nor to line their Coaches. I think
this reasonable enough, for it does not look very well in a pompous
Funeral.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Saltzbourg, April 2, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>At my departure from <i>Munich</i> I went and din'd at <i>Eversberg</i>, a Village
belonging to the Reverend Fathers the Jesuits, who have a House there
which is a large one, and that's all 'tis good for. I went and lay at
<span class="smcap">Wasserbourg</span> a Town of <i>Bavaria</i> built upon a Rock, so encompass'd with the
River <i>Inn</i> that 'tis a perfect Peninsula. Mountains and Rocks hang over
this Town as if they wou'd crush it, and indeed the Place is not worth
much Description. It was settled as a Dowry on the Electoress
<i>Theresa-Cunigunda Sobieski</i> who died last Month, but this Princess would
never live in it, nor indeed do I know any other Prince that would.</p>

<p>After having pass'd the <i>Inn</i><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> over a very slender wooden Bridge I
climb'd a high Mountain, got down another, ascended a third, and so I
travell'd all the way up Hill and down Hill till I came within two Leagues
of <i>Saltzbourg</i>, where the Country becomes more passible.</p>

<p>The City of <span class="smcap">Saltzbourg</span> as well as the whole Archbishoprick takes its Name
from the River <i>Saltz</i> which passes thro' the City and Country. It rises
in <i>Tirol</i> and loses itself in the <i>Inn</i>. The Mountains that
are<!--390.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
about
the Town make it not near so broad as 'tis long, tho' take it all together
'tis not a large Town. 'Tis very well fortify'd, and has a Castle which
standing on an Eminence forms as it were a Citadel. 'Tis furnish'd with a
good Arsenal, and all manner of Ammunition, and I have been assur'd that
of Gunpowder alone there are no less than 20000 Quintals. Some Years ago
when I was here, Lightning fell so near this Magazine that it wanted but
half a Foot of penetrating to the Powder, which if it had touch'd I fancy
I shou'd never have wrote to you more. There is always a Guard of fifty
Men at the Castle, and the Garison of the Town consists of 600 Men who are
lodg'd in the Caserns.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Saltzbourg</i> contains finer Edifices than many great Towns. It
has a magnificent Cathedral which was consecrated the 24th of <i>September</i>
1628, by an Archbishop who was of the Family of the Counts <i>de Lodron</i>.
'Tis a vast Structure of Free-stone, and has a stately Front which may be
reckon'd the compleatest in <i>Germany</i>. The skilful Architect by whom it
was directed has very much copy'd the Front of St. <i>Agnes's</i> Church in the
Square of <i>Navona</i> at <i>Rome</i>. It has four Marble Statues bigger than the
Life, which represent St. <i>Peter</i>, St. <i>Paul</i>, St. <i>Rupert</i>, and St.
<i>Virgilius</i>, of whom the two latter were the first Archbishops of this
See. The whole Church is adorn'd in the inside with Pilastres of the
<i>Corinthian</i> Order. 'Tis built in the Form of a Cross with a very high
Dome which separates the Nave from the Choir. The high Altar which is at
the bottom of the Choir is of Marble, as are the two Chapels that form the
Cross: The Pavement of the Church is of great Squares of Marble of various
Colours. 'Tis pity there was not more Inlet for Light, the Dome being the
only lightsome Part of it. But as the Church is magnificent
the<!--391.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Ornaments
of the high Altar are more so. Upon the Grand Festivals it bears a Sun of
Gold adorn'd with precious Stones to the Value of 100000 Crowns, a great
Cross of massy Gold, and four golden Candlesticks. The Front of the Altar,
and the Tabernacle are of massy Silver of excellent Workmanship.</p>

<p>St. <i>Rupert</i> surnam'd the Apostle of <i>Bavaria</i> was the first Bishop of
<i>Saltzbourg</i> in 582. <i>Leo</i> III. whom the Church honour'd as a Saint,
erected this Bishoprick into an Archbishoprick in favour of St. <i>Arnould</i>,
in the Year 798. He had for Suffragans the Bishops of <i>Freisingen</i>,
<i>Ratisbon</i>, <i>Passau</i>, <i>Briken</i>, <i>Gurck</i>, <i>Chiemsee</i>, <i>Seggau</i>, and
<i>Lavant</i>.</p>

<p>The Archbishop has a Right of Nomination to the four last Bishopricks;
only the Nomination to the Bishoprick of <i>Gurck</i> is alternative between
this Prelate and the Emperor, as Archduke of <i>Austria</i>. The four Bishops
bear the Title of Princes of the Empire, and enjoy all the Prerogatives
annexed to that high Dignity. Notwithstanding this, the Archbishop never
gives them the Preference, and when he talks to them, only compliments
them with the Title of <i>Euer Freuntschaft</i>, i. e. <i>Your Friendship</i>.
Service is perform'd in this Metropolis according to the Usage observ'd in
St. <i>Peter's</i> Church at <i>Rome</i>. The Chapter is compos'd of the Archbishop,
a Provost, a Dean, and twenty four Canons, all Men of Quality, who are
only oblig'd to four Months Residence, and the rest of the Time they may
go where they please. Both the Provost and Dean have the Crosier and
Mitre<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. The Archbishop, as well as the Elector of <i>Cologn</i>, has the
Privilege of dressing in the Habit of a Cardinal. This Prelate has the
Directorship of the College of Princes at the Dyet of the Empire
alternatively with the Archduke of <i>Austria</i>. He is moreover <i>Legatus
natus</i><!--392.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
<i>&amp; perpetuus</i> of the Holy See, and Primate of <i>Germany</i>. His
Titles are these, '<i>Leopold</i>, by the Grace of God, Archbishop of
<i>Saltzbourg</i>, and Prince of the Empire, perpetual Legate of the Holy
Apostolic See of <i>Rome</i>, Primate of <i>Germany</i>, descended of the
illustrious Family of the Barons of <i>Firmian</i>.'</p>

<p>The Archbishop at his coming to the See must pay 100000 Crowns to <i>Rome</i>
for the Pall, but the Country generally raises it for him, besides making
a free Gift of the like Sum to its new Prince. The Revenues of this
Prelate are about 1500000 Florins a Year. The very Salt which is carried
into <i>Bavaria</i> and <i>Swabia</i> brings him in 30000 Crowns. He is absolute
Master of all his Revenues, and accountable to no body for what he lays
out. The present Archbishop is of <i>Tirol</i>, of a distinguish'd Family, but
not favour'd much by Fortune. He was born the 26th of <i>May</i> 1679, and
succeeded <i>Francis-Anthony</i> the Count <i>de Harrach</i>. His Advancement was
owing to the Division of the Chapter, who all wanted to be either Bishops
themselves, or else to advance some one Friend or Cousin. After a great
many Debates and Messages sent forwards and backwards, their Choice fell
upon the Baron <i>de Firmian</i> who was at that time very infirm, which was
the only Thing that procur'd him the Mitre; for the Parties that divided
the Chapter united in his favour, because they thought him a Man not very
long-liv'd; but they believ'd however he might live long enough to give
each Party time to form its Cabals for advancing that Person to the
Bishoprick who they thought would best serve their Purpose. But all those
Gentlemen were mightily mistaken as to the Archbishop's Life. For this
Prelate, like another Pope <i>Sixtus</i> V. lost all his Infirmities when he
found the Mitre, and is very like to out-live many of his Electors.</p>

<!--393.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>This Prince is tall, has an austere haughty Air; seldom makes any
Compliments, and talks much less, except when he is hunting, which is all
the Pleasure of his Life. He is almost always alone, and generally eats by
himself. In the Summer-time he keeps altogether in the Country where he is
of very difficult Access, and keeps no Retinue, nor Company. He is accus'd
of being too thrifty, and I don't know but there may be something in it;
but perhaps he would not appear to be quite so saving if he had succeeded
any body else in the Bishoprick but the Count <i>de Harrach</i>, the most
generous, noble, and most magnificent Prelate of his Time. The Archbishop
is naturally a Valetudinarian; and under God, he is oblig'd for the
Preservation of his Life to his Physician <i>Gersner</i>, a Native of <i>Vienna</i>,
a Man of great Skill in his Profession, and of strict Honour and
Integrity, who has got so much the length of the Prelate's Foot that he is
almost the only Person that dares to speak to him with Freedom. The Count
<i>d'Arco</i> Son to the Archbishop's Sister is this Prelate's only Darling;
for to the surprize of the whole Court, and Chapter, he prefers him before
a Nephew of his own Name, a Canon of <i>Saltzbourg</i> and of <i>Trent</i>, a young
Clergyman of great Hopes.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of the <i>Lodron</i> Family who caus'd the Metropolis to be
built, likewise founded the Archiepiscopal Palace, the Fortifications, and
the Stables, which were all finish'd in the thirty two Years that he was
Archbishop. The Apartments of the Palace being not laid out altogether in
the modern Taste, the deceased Archbishop <i>Anthony</i> Count <i>de Harrach</i>,
made a thorough Change in them, and left little more than the Outside
standing. The Palace at <i>Saltzbourg</i> is now more magnificent than many
royal Houses. It contains 173 Rooms all richly furnish'd, without
reckoning the Halls and Galleries. The Archbishop's Apartment
is<!--394.png--><span class="pagenum">369</span>
stately:
It has a great Marble Stair-case divided into three Flights, which leads
into a spacious Guard-Chamber, from whence one enters into the
Archbishop's Apartment consisting of several Rooms, where able <i>Italian</i>
Masters have adorn'd the Cielings with very good Draughts. One is really
surprized to see the Richness of the Furniture, and the infinite Variety
of other things that are distributed up and down this vast Apartment; such
as Marble Tables adorn'd with gilt Mouldings; old Porcellain of the most
beautiful sort; Lustres of massy Silver, and Rock Crystal of uncommon
Workmanship; Chandeliers also of Silver or Crystal upon large gilded
Stands, and a multitude of other things very well worth observation.</p>

<p>How magnificent soever this Apartment is, there's another made use of upon
Days of Ceremony which infinitely surpasses it. I will only mention the
principal Rooms of it. We first enter into a great Salon adorn'd with the
Pictures of no less than fourscore Archbishops of <i>Saltzbourg</i>. Next to it
there's another Salon ingeniously and magnificently decorated, which
discovers Grandeur in every part of it. 'Tis furnish'd with a Suit of
Hangings of Crimson-Damask with Gold Lace, forming a rich Architecture in
Pilasters of the Composite Order, the Frize of which is adorn'd with a
pair of Brackets, which is a vast Addition to the whole Decoration. The
rich Gilding shines every where with profusion. At one end of the Room
there stands in the Wall a sumptuous Beaufet of Silver gilt, and at the
other there's a rich Canopy under which the Archbishop sits when he dines
in State. There's a stately Lustre in the middle of the Room which
consists of magnificent pieces of Rock Crystal. At the end of this grand
Apartment there are two Galleries that deserve the attention of the
Curious in Painting, who will certainly pass their time here very
agreeably,<!--395.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
and find a great many choice Pictures done by the best
Masters. The Chimney-piece of the first of these Galleries is a great
Ornament to it, being of the finest Marble adorn'd with Brass, gilt with
Water-Gold. Over it there's a Statue of Brass as big as the Life
representing <i>Antinous</i>. The second Gallery is as magnificent as the
first. The Floor, Cieling, Door-Cases, and all the Ornaments in general
are of fine Marble. The Walls are painted in Fresco, and exhibit
Geographical Charts of the principal Dominions in <i>Europe</i> in divers
Pictures, which are executed with very great Art and Exactness both as to
the Painting and Disposition of the Things that are the Subjects of it.</p>

<p>A third Apartment which is over the Archbishop's is for lodging foreign
Princes, and is not inferiour to the others in Grandeur and Magnificence.
It consists of several Rooms all in a row. In one Room there are all the
Pictures of the Emperors from <i>Charlemain</i> to <i>Charles</i> VI. The Rooms that
follow it are hung with very rich Tapestry, particularly one Set
representing the War between <i>Pompey</i> and <i>Cæsar</i>, which is so wonderfully
well drawn that the Marshal <i>de Daun</i> Governour of <i>Milan</i> offer'd 40000
Florins for it to the late Archbishop. I shall say nothing of the other
Apartments, having treated so much of the Archiepiscopal Palace; tho' if
it had belong'd to a Temporal Prince I should have said much less of it,
but I thought fit to give you an Idea of the Wealth of a Prelate.</p>

<p>Adjoining to the Palace there is a great Building which serves for lodging
the Archbishop's Domestics. The Stables are fit for a King, and if a
<i>Frenchman</i> was to see them he would be forc'd to own that as to the
Inside they are more magnificent than the so much boasted Stables of
<i>Versailles</i>. They hold 150 Horses in two Rows, with a broad Walk in the
middle; and the Roof which is pretty
high<!--396.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
is supported by two Ranges of
Stone-Pillars. Next to these Stables is a Riding-House cover'd, the
Ceiling of which being painted in Fresco, represents a Tournament; and all
round it there is a Gallery. 'Tis pity that this magnificent Riding-House
is not broader. There's another Riding-House uncovered which has not its
Fellow in the World. 'Tis a very great square Place, three Sides of which
are lin'd by very high Rocks, in which three Rows of Seats are very
artfully cut out for the Spectators, when there is any Carousal, or Combat
of wild Beasts. The whole Work is really magnificent, and the old <i>Romans</i>
would not have been ashamed to own it.</p>

<p><i>Trinity-College</i> Church is extremely well adorned. The Floor is of
Marble, and the Roof painted with a great deal of Art, representing the
Assumption of the Virgin, and the Crown placing on her Head by God the
Father and by Jesus Christ. The High-Altar is of a very singular Form, but
very magnificent. Two Angels of Brass, exceeding human Stature, in a
Posture of Humility and Adoration, support a Heart of Brass which serves
for a Tabernacle. Over it is a Globe, between God the Father and the
Redeemer. God the Father seems to rest his right hand upon the Globe, and
presents the left to our Lord, who puts his left upon the Globe, and in
the right holds a Cross. They are supported by very large Rays which shine
with very rich Gilding. This stately Groupe is surmounted with a Glory, in
the midst of which the Holy Ghost appears in form of a Dove, extending its
Rays over God the Father, and God the Son. The whole is of Brass gilt with
Gold, of a very curious Fancy.</p>

<p>Near this magnificent Church is the Palace of <i>Mirabel</i>, where the late
Archbishop the Count <i>de Harrach</i>, used to spend the Summer. This Prince
who is truly magnificent in every thing, caus'd this House to be built at
a great Expence from the
very<!--397.png--><span class="pagenum">372</span>
Foundation; but the Architect whom he
employ'd has not answer'd his Intention, and it appears that he did not
understand the proper Distribution of the Apartments. Every Part of it
indeed taken distinctly, is beautiful, but there is not one in its proper
Place. The grand Stair-Case is very fine, as well for its Contrivance as
for its rich Ornaments, but 'tis placed in a Corner, and without a Guide
'tis no easy matter to find it. The Salon, which is the Master-piece of
the Archbishop's Apartments, is worth the Observation of the Curious, with
respect to the grand Manner in which 'tis painted: Marble, Brass, and
Gilding, seem to have been bestowed on it with profusion. As to the
Pilasters, the <i>Corinthian</i> Order is entirely observed; and there are
Basso-Relievos imitating Brass which are well design'd, and make a very
good appearance. 'Tis pity this fine Salon wants proportion, it being much
too lofty for its Size; and 'tis still more to be lamented that it has not
a Prospect over the Gardens, the River of <i>Saltz</i>, and the adjacent
Country, which are the Objects that are discover'd from the Apartments
next to the Salon.</p>

<p>The Chapel of <i>Mirabel</i> is also very magnificent; and though but of a
middling Size, is not inferior to the finest Churches. This Palace is
accompanied with Gardens finely adorned with Fountains and Statues; and
there are several Orange-Trees planted in the Ground, which are cover'd up
in the Winter in a wooden Box.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, have I given you a very particular Account of the City of
<i>Saltzbourg</i>: What remains for me is to speak of the Archbishop's
Houshold, which will give you an Idea of his Wealth and Grandeur. This
Prince has</p>

<div class="center">
A Steward,<br />
A Great Chamberlain,<br />
A Grand Marshal,<br />
A Master of the Horse,<br />
<!--398.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>A
Great Huntsman,<br />
A Captain of the Guards,<br />
A Master-Cook,<br />
A Pay-Master,<br />
Twenty-four Chamberlains,<br />
Sixteen Gentlemen-Servants called <i>Truchsses</i>,<br />
Sixteen Pages,<br />
Fifteen Ushers of the Cabinet,<br />
Eleven Ushers of the Chamber,<br />
Forty-two Valets de Chambre,<br />
Twenty-eight Footmen,<br />
Eighteen Cooks.
</div>

<p>How many Coachmen and Grooms he has I know not, but there must be a great
number of 'em, the Archbishop having 750 Horses.</p>

<p>Besides the Officers that I have now mentioned, there are also the Great
Hereditary Officers of the Archbishoprick, who are four.</p>

<p>The eldest of the <i>Lodron</i> Family is Hereditary Grand Marshal.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Kuenbourg</i> is Great-Cup-Bearer.</p>

<p>The Office of Master of the Pantry is vacant by the death of the Count <i>de
Thanhausen</i>, the last of his Family.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Torring</i> is Great Chamberlain.</p>

<p>All these Offices are executed by the eldest Sons of the Families
above-mentioned.</p>

<p>The Archbishop confers the Order of St. <i>Hubert</i>, which was instituted the
25th of <i>November</i>, 1702, by the Archbishop <i>John-Ernest</i>, who has thereto
annexed six Commanderies, or Prebends, of a considerable Revenue.</p>

<p>The Archbishops are obliged for most of their Wealth to the Princes of
<i>Bavaria</i><a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. Mean time the Members of the Chapter of <i>Saltzbourg</i> admit
of<!--399.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
no Princes, that they may have a Plea for refusing the Princes of
<i>Bavaria</i>, of whose Power they are jealous; in which I think they shew
more regard to the Rules of Policy than those of Gratitude.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Saltzbourg</i> is worth seeing, but does not afford Amusement.
Every one lives here for his own sake, and except some Gentlemen of the
Chapter, and the Master of the Horse, who is the Count <i>de Truchsses
Zeil</i>, there's nobody to visit. The latter is a Nobleman whose Manners and
Sentiments are intirely conformable to his Birth. I know nobody that is
more polite; and I have abundant reason to praise his Civility to me. He
is of a Family, one Branch of which is settled in <i>Prussia</i>, where it has
for a long time held distinguished Employments, and produced Subjects of
great Merit who have done the State good Service.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention two things to you that are worth seeing, <i>viz.</i> the
Capuchins Convent, from whence there's a Prospect of a vast Tract of
Country; and St. <i>Sebastian</i>'s Church-yard, in which is interr'd the
celebrated <i>Paracelsus</i>; his Tomb lies in a Place very much neglected,
behind a Door, where a <i>Latin</i> Epitaph says, 'There rests
<i>Philip-Theophrastus Paracelsus</i>, the famous Physician, who with wonderful
Art cured the Leprosy, Gout, Dropsy, and other incurable Distempers; and
who after having given all his Estate to the Poor, died <i>September</i> 24,
1541.'</p>

<p><i>Paracelsus</i> cured most of his Patients by Sympathy, which made the
Vulgar, who are always apt to run into extremes, believe that he was a
Magician. He wrote several Books, whereof one of the most curious is his
<i>Treatise of Secret Philosophy</i>, which really contains such Passages as
would make one believe that if <i>Paracelsus</i> was not a Conjurer himself, he
was at least one of the Sect.</p>

<!--400.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<p>St. <i>Sebastian</i>'s Church-yard is a square Place, encompassed with a
Gallery supported by Arches: 'tis 119 Paces in length, and 96 in breadth.</p>

<p>The Neighbourhood of <i>Saltzbourg</i> is not disagreeable; and though the
Valley in which the City lies is pretty much inclosed with Mountains, yet
it presents several Objects that are pleasing to the Sight.</p>

<p>The Archbishop has two Pleasure-Houses, <i>viz.</i> <i>Cleisheim</i> and <i>Heilbron</i>,
which are both of them beautiful and magnificent. <i>Heilbron</i> especially is
worth seeing on account of its fine Waters and Cascades.</p>

<p>I hope to write to you speedily from <i>Venice</i>, and perhaps you will hear
from me when I come to <i>Inspruc</i>; but this will depend on the Stay I shall
make there, and on the departure of the Post.</p>

<div class="c3"><i>POSTSCRIPT.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Since the year 1730, that this Letter was wrote, great
Revolutions have happened in the Archbishoprick of <i>Saltzbourg</i>,
with regard to Religion; for about 22,000 Persons have abandoned
this Country, together with their Estates and their Fortunes,
and declared themselves of the <i>Lutheran</i> Communion; which is
very strange, and almost inconceivable! For in short, those
People never knew any Clergy but their own Priests, they lived
in a Country where there was no Controversy about Religion,
because all the Inhabitants were reckon'd staunch Catholics, by
consequence those People could not be instructed; and even the
greatest part of them could not read, but were bred up in such
gross Ignorance that they scarce knew the Principles of
Christianity. Therefore how could these poor People know that
they were in an Error?</div>

<div class="blockquot">I am not ignorant that at the beginning of the pretended
Reformation, there were <i>Saltzburghers</i> that followed the
Doctrines of <i>Luther</i>, such as <i>Staupitz</i>, Abbot of <i>St.
Peter</i>'s at <i>Saltzbourg</i>; <i>Paul Speratus</i>, a Preacher in the
Cathedral of this City; and several others. But <i>Lutheranism</i>
was thought to be quite suppressed in this Province, when it
seem'd all on a sudden to take deeper Root than ever; tho', as I
said before, I can't conceive how it should happen. Is it
possible that the Archbishop, the
Curates<!--401.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
and <i>Priests</i> should
take so little care of what ought to have been most dear to
them, I mean the Salvation of Souls, as that so many Thousands
of People should pass with them for good <i>Romans</i>, at the same
time that they abhorred <i>Rome</i> and its Precepts? For in short, I
suppose, and believe too, that there have ever been Protestants
in this Country, since the pretended Reformation; it being not
in the power of Man to destroy a Religion when once it has had
Followers in a Country; but the Difficulty is, how those
Sectaries should subsist there, without the Knowledge of an
ecclesiastical Sovereign; and how it was possible for them, not
only to subsist, but even to multiply, and the Priests and
Archbishop not perceive it. Ought not the Curates to know the
Sentiments of their Parishioners by Confession? Ought they not
to acquaint the Archbishop their Head of it? and ought not this
Prelate and his Priests to endeavour to reclaim those that go
astray, by the Example of a lively Faith, and by charitable
Exhortations, and from a Compassion for their Error, diligently
to oppose the Propagation of it? But all this has been
neglected: The Priests, and their Archbishop, knew not there was
a Fire, 'till 'twas too late to put it out; and instead of the
Good-nature, Compassion, and Charity, which like Water were
necessary to extinguish it, they pour'd in the Oil of Hatred and
Violence, and abandoned themselves to their furious Zeal. The
haughty, rigid, and severe Archbishop, forgetting that he was
both a Father and an Archbishop, and giving way to the Violence
of his Temper, has for ever lost those Souls which he might have
hoped to reclaim, by Instructions truly pastoral, and treating
them as Children led astray; whereas this Prelate, by using the
contrary Method, has caused a great many Persons to declare
themselves Protestants, who would have died in the Bosom of the
Church, if the proper Remedies had been employed, to bring them
back to it.</div>

<div class="blockquot">But I am persuaded that among the Emigrants of <i>Saltzbourg</i>,
there is a vast number who made Religion only a Cloak to leave
their Country, in hopes of bettering their Fortunes elsewhere,
and who were seduced by the ensnaring Temptation of throwing off
the Yoak of Submission. Be this as it will, those unfortunate
Subjects, like the <i>Jews</i>, are spread into divers Countries, as
<i>Germany</i>, <i>Holland</i>, and <i>Prussia</i>, where the King, I must
confess, (as much a Catholic as I am) has received them with a
Charity and Generosity perfectly christian and royal; his
Majesty having grudg'd neither Care nor Expence to convince the
World that as <i>France</i> is the Asylum of unfortunate Kings, so
the Dominions of <i>Prussia</i> are the Refuge of oppressed Subjects.</div>

<h2>LETTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Inspruc, April 9, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I travelled hither all the way from <i>Saltzbourg</i>, with the same Horses,
which is what I will never do again; for travelling by Post is always
best; and though 'tis more expensive, yet on the other hand 'tis less
fatiguing.</p>

<p>Three Leagues from <i>Saltzbourg</i> stands the little Town of <span class="smcap">Halle</span>, which
belongs to the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i>, and is a Place considerable for its
Salt-Pits. It lies in a small Valley crossed by three Rivers, form'd by
Torrents from the Mountains, which bring down a vast quantity of floating
Wood, that is stopp'd at <i>Halle</i> by the Piles which either cross or shut
up the Rivers. They lay the Wood up in store for the Salt-Works, which
consume a great quantity of it.</p>

<p>After I had been all over the Salt-Works, I went and din'd at
<i>Schneitzenrieth</i>, a sorry Village, where, however, I far'd better than I
have done at many good Towns.</p>

<p>When I had dined I pursued my Journey, and having travelled four Leagues,
entred the Country of <span class="smcap">Tirol</span>, the Passage to which is very much straitened,
so that there's scarce room for a Waggon, by two very high Rocks or
Mountains, and two Forts between them, one belonging to the Archbishoprick
of <i>Saltzbourg</i>, and the other to the County of <i>Tirol</i>. Each Sovereign
keeps a Garrison in his Fort, and Officers to receive the Duties.</p>

<!--403.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>I lay that Evening at <span class="smcap">Wahtringen</span>, the first Village in the Dominions of
<i>Tirol</i>, as one comes out of <i>Germany</i>. I here found a Parcel of Boys
running about with lighted Touchwood in their hands, to the Houses, Woods,
and Fields. Having ask'd an old Man the meaning of it, he told me that the
Wood so lighted was consecrated by the Parson of the Parish, and had the
virtue of securing all Places to which it was carried, against Lightning.
This Consecration of the Wood is always perform'd the <i>Saturday</i> before
<i>Easter</i>, when a great Pile is erected before the Church, into which the
Parson throws Holy water, and then sets fire to It. When the whole is well
kindled, every one strives to snatch a Firebrand, with which they run to
their Houses and Lands, but with so little care that I wonder they don't
set every place they come to in a Flame.</p>

<p>From <i>Halle</i> to <i>Wahtringen</i> the Country is every bit uncultivated. The
Inhabitants live upon Milk, Pickled Cabbage, and Water-gruel. They have no
Corn but what comes from <i>Bavaria</i>. All their Substance and Trade is in
Cattle, and their Mountains afford excellent Pasture.</p>

<p>Upon <i>Easter-day</i> I heard Mass at <i>St. John</i>'s, a great Village where
there's a very pretty Church. I was very much pleased with the Sermon that
was preached by the Parson, and with the Regularity with which the whole
Divine Service was performed.</p>

<p>After Mass I went and din'd at <span class="smcap">Elvan</span>, to which place I came through a
Valley, which in the Summer time must be very agreeable, but at the
present Season is all covered with Snow. I was not more edified at
<i>Wahtringen</i>, than I was scandalized at <i>Elvan</i>, to catch my Landlord, a
clever, merry Blade, engaged with one of his Maids in something else
instead of telling their Beads. My Presence
was<!--404.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
so far from spoiling
Sport that my Landlord invited me very civilly to do as he did, assuring
me that his House was well furnish'd with Nymphs. In a very little time I
was convinced that what he said was true, for being obliged by the Cold to
stay in the common Room while one was aired for me, I saw half a score
Lasses come in, who were all of them my Landlord's very humble Servants,
and not in the least disposed to imitate the eleven thousand Virgins.</p>

<p>After Dinner, pursuing my way through Snows and Rocks, I went and lay at
<i>Kundahl</i>. Next day I got beyond the Snow, and crossed a very pleasant
Valley which brought me to <span class="smcap">Ratenberg</span>, a Town on the Banks of the <i>Inn</i>,
defended by a Castle built on a Rock, and stronger by its Situation than
by its Works. The Elector <i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i> of <i>Bavaria</i> coming before
this Castle on the 13th of <i>June</i>, 1703, obliged the Garrison, which was
composed of the Militia, to surrender at Discretion. From this Fort to
<i>Inspruc</i> I always kept along the River <i>Inn</i>, which runs through a fine
Valley between high Mountains that are much steeper on the right side of
the River than the left; nevertheless there are Houses on them that are
inhabited by the Miners. I can't imagine how it was possible for the good
People to build in Places so inconvenient; for their Houses look as if
they were stuck on to the Rocks, and as if nothing but a Goat or a Swallow
could come at them. The whole Valley is very populous, and abounds with
pretty Villages, Castles, and fine Country-Houses.</p>

<p>At the end of it stands the Town of <span class="smcap">Schwatz</span>, which is very well built. The
Parish Church is an ancient, fair, large Edifice; and wholly covered with
Copper, as most of the Churches in <i>Tirol</i> are with Tin painted green,
which has a very pretty look. The Houses at <i>Schwatz</i> are generally of
Brick, so that 'tis very rare to see one of Timber. I
observ'd<!--405.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
at the Inn
where I din'd, and throughout the whole Country of <i>Tirol</i>, that when
People came into any House, they said to the Master of it, <i>Hail, Jesus
Christ!</i> to which he answered, <i>May Christ be praised, and the holy Virgin
his Mother</i>. Then the Master of the House stepp'd forward, and took the
Visitor by his hand. This method of saluting is practised among all the
People throughout <i>Tirol</i>; and the Salutation is fix'd up in Print at all
the Doors, with an Advertisement tack'd to it, importing, that Pope
<i>Clement</i> XI. had granted an hundred Days of Indulgence, and plenary
Absolution, in favour of those who should pronounce the Salutation and the
Answer.</p>

<p>After having din'd at <i>Schwatz</i>, I continued to ride along the <i>Inn</i>; and
three Leagues beyond that I pass'd the River, over a Bridge near
<i>Fultishau</i>, a fine Convent of the Servite-Fryars, and went to <span class="smcap">Halle</span>, the
second City of <i>Tirol</i>. The reverend Fathers the <i>Jesuits</i> have a fine
House here, and a noble Church, with a great Garden to it. The Mint is
also worth seeing, where they coin a great quantity of Species from the
Silver and Copper taken out of the Mines of <i>Tirol</i>. The Water is brought
to it by wooden Pipes. They drive a great Trade at <i>Halle</i> in Copper, Tin,
and Salt, which is produced there in abundance, the Vent of it being
promoted by means of the River <i>Inn</i>, which becomes navigable at <i>Halle</i>.</p>

<p>From this Town to <i>Inspruc</i> 'tis two Leagues, and a strait even Road which
deserves to be planted on each side with Trees. <span class="smcap">Inspruc</span>, the Capital City
of <i>Tirol</i>, stands in the middle of a Valley, on the Banks of the <i>Inn</i>,
over which there's a wooden Bridge that leads to the Suburbs. <i>Inspruc</i>
was heretofore the Residence of the Archdukes, the Sovereigns of <i>Tirol</i>;
but since the august House of <i>Austria</i> has been reduced in <i>Germany</i> to
the
Imperial<!--406.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Branch singly, this City has been only subject to Governors,
who however were always great Noblemen. <i>Charles</i> Duke of <i>Lorrain</i>, who
married the Queen Dowager of <i>Poland</i>, Sister to the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>,
and who made himself famous by the Victories which he gain'd over the
<i>Turks</i>, held this important Office. That Prince dying at <i>Inspruc</i>, was
succeeded by <i>Charles</i> Prince Palatine of <i>Newbourg</i>, Brother to the
Empress <i>Eleonora</i>, <i>Leopold</i>'s third Wife, but he renounced the
Government of <i>Tirol</i>, on his Accession to the Electorate. He liv'd at
<i>Inspruc</i>, with great Pomp, and his Absence is still very much lamented
there. Since he went away, the Government of <i>Tirol</i> has remain'd vacant.
They say 'tis designed for the Archduchess <i>Mary-Magdalen</i>, the Emperor's
youngest Sister. This I know is what the Burghers of <i>Inspruc</i> wish for;
but I don't think the Nobility do; because the Presence of the Archduchess
would oblige the People of Quality to be at very great Expence; for they
would be under a necessity of going to Court, as well as of carrying it
more civilly to their Vassals.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Konickel</i> is the Chief of the Regency: He has the Title of
<i>Landshauptman</i>, which is much the same with Lieutenant-General of the
Province, wherein he has the absolute Command, and all the Sovereign
Courts depend on him. This Nobleman is a <i>Tirolese</i>, and lodges in a fine
House which has been built by order of the States of <i>Tirol</i>, for the
Residence of their <i>Landshauptman</i>. He conducts himself with Dignity, and
is civil to Foreigners.</p>

<p>'Twas at <i>Inspruc</i> that the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. received one of the
greatest Shocks he had met with in all his Life. For he was surprized
there with his Brother <i>Ferdinand</i>, King of the <i>Romans</i>, by <i>Maurice</i>
Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, who, though his Creature, made War upon him
nevertheless, on account
of<!--407.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Religion. The Emperor and his Brother were so
near being taken that they had but just time to make their Escape to
<i>Villaco</i>, a little Town upon the <i>Drave</i> in <i>Carinthia</i>. This was a
terrible Reverse of Fortune for a Prince, who, but a few years before, had
a Pope and a King of <i>France</i> too, his Prisoners.</p>

<p><i>Maximilian-Emanuel</i> Elector of <i>Bavaria</i> was not more fortunate at
<i>Inspruc</i> than <i>Charles</i> V. for though he made himself Master of it in
<i>June</i> 1703, he was obliged to abandon it in <i>July</i> following, and to
retire to <i>Bavaria</i>, after having tried in vain to force Passes which were
in a manner inaccessible by Nature, and guarded not only by the Peasants
but by regular Troops. His Design was to have joined M. <i>de Vendosme</i> in
the County of <i>Trent</i>, and by that means to have opened a Communication
with the <i>Milanese</i>. The Elector, whilst he was retreating, ran the hazard
several times of losing his Life; and his Troops were for the most part
knock'd o' th' head by Stones which the Peasants hurl'd at them in the
Defiles which they were obliged to pass.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Inspruc</i> is absolutely defenceless, and were it not for its
Suburbs, would be one of the least Cities in all <i>Germany</i>; but those
Suburbs are very large, and the Residence of Persons of the greatest
Distinction. The Houses are very commodious, well built of Brick, and for
the most part with Piazzas, which is a great Conveniency to the
Foot-passengers. There was heretofore great Store of Salt here, but for
some years past the Pits are dry, which is a Loss to <i>Inspruc</i> of no less
than 200,000 Florins a-year.</p>

<p>Though the City is small yet there are several very fine things to be seen
in it. Such is the ancient Palace of the Archdukes, a vast large
Structure, but without Architecture, or any manner
of<!--408.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Regularity. There
are Pictures in it done by skilful Hands, particularly in that call'd the
Giant's-Hall, where the Story of <i>Dejanira</i> is represented with very great
Art and Perfection.</p>

<p>The Palace has very great Gardens belonging to it, but they are not well
kept; yet there are the Remains of noble Fountains and brazen Statues.
Among the latter is an Equestrian Statue of an Archduke of <i>Austria</i>, who
is represented as large as the Life, in Armour, with Breeches after the
Fashion of the Ancients, a Ruff, and little Boots. The Horse seems to rest
upon his Haunches, in an Attitude as if he was just ready to leap off the
Pedestal.</p>

<p>The Prince <i>Charles</i> of <i>Newbourg</i>, the present Elector Palatine, finding
the old Castle not commodious enough, caused one to be built of Wood;
which was some years ago burnt down to the ground by an accidental Fire.</p>

<p>The Parish Church is of modern Building, with a great Dome raised in the
middle of the Cross. The whole Architecture of this Edifice is of the
<i>Corinthian</i> Order. The Front is expos'd to an advantagious Point of View
on a Square, and is adorned with three Orders, one above another, which
makes the Fabric to rise in the whole to about 120 Foot height, exclusive
of a great flight of Steps to it, after the manner of <i>Italy</i>. All the
Parts of this Structure are charged with Ornaments of a clumsey Invention,
and very ill executed; so that the Confusion resulting from it is
infinitely shocking to those that have a nice Taste of Architecture. The
Inside is more tolerable than the Outside, and is even magnificent. The
whole Length from the Entrance to the Foot of the High-Altar, is 432 Feet.
The Foundation of it was laid while <i>Charles de Newbourg</i> was Governor of
<i>Tirol</i>, who plac'd the first Stone of it. The whole
Decoration<!--409.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
of this
Church consists in Pilasters of red Marble, with a Vein of white, and the
Chapiters are of Plaister. The Roof is painted in Fresco by <i>Gosman-Daniel
Ossem</i>, a Native of <i>Munich</i>, who has succeeded so well as to give entire
satisfaction to such as have a Taste for, and Skill in things that are
curious. The High-Altar stands under the Arch at the end opposite to the
Nave of the Church. 'Tis perfectly magnificent, adorned with four great
Pillars of the Composite Order, of green Marble with white Veins, whose
Chapiters and Basons are of Marble of various Colours; and they support a
Canopy, which is form'd by four Curves fill'd with a Glory.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle and the Front of the Altar are of massy Silver, charged
with several Mouldings, and Foliages of Silver gilt; and there are few
Altars more splendidly decorated. There is a miraculous Image of the holy
Virgin, which the Archduke <i>Leopold</i>, the Sovereign of <i>Tirol</i>, brought
hither from <i>Dresden</i>. That Prince made a Visit to the Elector of
<i>Saxony</i>, who shewing him his Treasure, desir'd him to chuse any Piece
that he lik'd best; <i>Leopold</i> singled out this Figure, because he was told
that in the early days of Lutheranism, it had been cast three times in the
Fire, and always taken out again without any damage. The Archduke on his
return to his Dominions, made a Present of this Image to the Parish, and
it has ever since been held in great veneration, and never fail'd of
working great Miracles. Three great Lamps of massy Silver are continually
burning before it; and the other Chapels have each a Lamp of solid Silver
whose Light is always shining. All this Plate was given to the Church by
the Elector Palatine.</p>

<p>The famous golden Roof is near the Parish Church, and serves to cover a
Balcony of the Chancery which fronts the Square. They say that <i>Frederic</i>
of <i>Austria</i>, the Sovereign of <i>Tirol</i>, caused
this<!--410.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Roof to be made, to
let his Subjects see that he was not so bare of Money as they thought him,
and that he did not deserve the Nickname they had given him of the
<i>Pennyless Prince</i>. There are many however who affirm that this Roof is
not of Gold, while others say the contrary. As far as I can judge of it, I
believe 'tis of Copper only covered with very thin Plates of Gold, and by
consequence of no great Value. And supposing the whole Roof was of solid
Gold, I don't believe the Expence was very extraordinary, though to be
sure it was by much too great for so mean a purpose.</p>

<p>The House or College of the reverend Fathers the Jesuits, is a very great
Building in which no Cost has been spared. Its principal Front is 166
Paces in length. These Fathers are the Directors of the University. Near
to their College is the Church of the <i>Franciscans</i>, whose Convent was
founded by the pious Legacies of the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i>, who on his
Death-bed ordered his Successor to cause this House and Church to be built
at <i>Inspruc</i>. His Grandson <i>Ferdinand</i> I. Son to <i>Philip</i> the Fair,
perform'd his Will, and in honour of his Grandfather's Memory, raised him
a Marble Tomb which may be rank'd among the most stately <i>Mausoleums</i> in
<i>Europe</i>. The Emperor <i>Maximilian</i> is there represented on his Knees upon
a Cushion, with his Hands lifted up to Heaven, and as it were prostrate in
Prayer: He is adorned with the Crown, and the Imperial <i>Dalmatic</i>. This
Figure is of a gigantic Size, and admirably well done in Brass. 'Tis
plac'd on a great high Base of black Marble, forming an oblong Square, on
an Ascent of three Steps of red Marble. The whole Base is divided into
twenty-four Compartiments, or square Tables of white Marble, representing
the memorable Actions of <i>Maximilian</i> in excellent Bas-Reliefs.
The<!--411.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
four
cardinal Virtues in a mournful Attitude, are represented in Brass, as
sitting on the Corners of the <i>Mausoleum</i>, and looking on <i>Maximilian</i>'s
Statue. The entire <i>Mausoleum</i> stands by itself in the middle of the
Church; and the following Inscription is engraved in Letters of Gold all
round the Base of this Monument;</p>

<p>All this fine <i>Mausoleum</i> was executed with very great Care and Skill, by
<i>Alexander Colin</i>, a Native of <i>Mechlin</i>; the Picture of which ingenious
Painter, and that of his Wife, are kept in the Church, as an
Acknowledgment due to that excellent Artist. This <i>Mausoleum</i> was mightily
enriched by the Magnificence of <i>Frederic</i> Archduke of <i>Austria</i>, surnamed
the <i>Pennyless Prince</i>, who caused to be placed
in<!--412.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
the Nave of the Church
twenty-eight Statues of Brass seven Foot in height, representing so many
Princes and Princesses that were related to the House of <i>Austria</i>. They
are set up in two Rows from the great Gate to the Altar, and therefore
separate the Nave from the two Wings on the Sides. 'Tis pity that those
Statues are in the hands of Monks who neglect them very much, and suffer
the Dust to eat into them. They would do much better in a Royal Palace:
Some of them are in great perfection. I fancy you will be glad to know the
Names of the Persons they represent.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I. The first, beginning on the right Side of the Altar, is the Figure of
<i>Joan</i> of <i>Castile</i>, Mother to <i>Charles</i> V. and <i>Ferdinand</i> I. the Heads
of the two Branches of the House of <i>Austria</i>; the first of which became
extinct by the Death of <i>Charles</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>, but the second
still flourishes among us with Glory in the Person of the August <i>Charles</i>
VI.</p>

<p>II. <i>Ferdinand</i> the Catholic, Father to <i>Joan</i>.</p>

<p>III. <i>Cunigonda</i> Archduchess, Daughter to the Emperor <i>Frederic</i> IV. and
Wife to <i>Albert</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>, who died a Nun.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Margaret</i>, Daughter to <i>Henry</i> Duke of <i>Carinthia</i> and Count of
<i>Tirol</i>, surnamed the <i>Pious</i>, because she founded and built several
Convents. This Princess was nicknamed <i>Margaret Wide-Mouth</i>: She was
marry'd first to <i>John</i> Margrave of <i>Moravia</i>, Son to the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> IV. whom she surviv'd, and marry'd to her second Husband
<i>Lewis</i>, Margrave of <i>Brandenburg</i>, Son to the Emperor <i>Lewis</i> of
<i>Bavaria</i>, whom she also surviv'd, and finding herself a Widow a second
time, and without Issue to enjoy what she had, she made a Present of the
County of <i>Tirol</i> whereof she was Sovereign, to her Cousins <i>Rodolph</i>,
<i>Albert</i>, and <i>Leopold</i>
of<!--413.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
<i>Austria</i>, which Grant was confirm'd by the
Emperor <i>Charles</i> IV. in 1364.</p>

<p>V. <i>Mary of Burgundy</i>, Wife to the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i> I. the richest
Heiress of her Time.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Elizabeth</i>, the Daughter of the Emperor <i>Sigismond</i>, and Wife to the
Emperor <i>Albert</i> II. who carry'd the Duchy of <i>Luxembourg</i> to the House of
<i>Austria</i>. She was Mother to the unfortunate King <i>Ladislaus</i>.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Godfrey</i> of <i>Bouillon</i>, Duke of <i>Lorrain</i>, King of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
plac'd here among the Princes of the House of <i>Austria</i>, as being
descended from the same Family as they.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Albert</i> I. Emperor.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Frederic</i>, Archduke of <i>Austria</i>, he who was nicknamed Prince
<i>Pennyless</i>.</p>

<p>X. <i>Leopold</i> of <i>Austria</i>, surnamed the <i>Virtuous</i>, Son of <i>Albert</i> the
<i>Wise</i>.</p>

<p>XI, and XII. Opinions are very much divided about the Persons who are
represented by these two Statues; but 'tis generally thought they are the
Emperors <i>Charles</i> V. and <i>Ferdinand</i> I.</p>

<p>XIII. The Emperor <i>Frederic</i> IV. Father to <i>Maximilian</i> I.</p>

<p>XIV. <i>Albert</i> II. Emperor, King of <i>Hungary</i> and <i>Bohemia</i>, and Father to
the unfortunate King <i>Ladislaus</i>.</p>

<p>XV. <i>Clovis</i>, the first Christian King of <i>France</i>, who is plac'd among
the Princes of the House of <i>Austria</i>, because their Genealogists derive
them from the ancient <i>Franks</i> who subdued <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>XVI. <i>Philip</i> I. call'd the Fair, King of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>XVII. The Emperor <i>Rodolph</i> I.</p>

<p>XVIII. The Archduke <i>Albert</i>, call'd the <i>Wise</i>.</p>

<p>XIX. <i>Theodoric</i> King of the <i>Goths</i>. I am not a Genealogist good enough
to tell you in what Relation he stands to the House of <i>Austria</i>.</p>

<!--414.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p>

<p>XX. <i>Ernest</i>, Archduke, Grandfather to <i>Maximilian</i> I.</p>

<p>XXI. <i>Theodebert</i> Count of <i>Provence</i>, from whom descended the Dukes of
<i>Burgundy</i> and the Counts of <i>Hapsburg</i>.</p>

<p>XXII. <i>Arthur</i>, Prince of <i>Wales</i>, who marry'd <i>Catherine</i> of <i>Arragon</i>.</p>

<p>XXIII. <i>Sigismond</i>, Archduke and Count of <i>Tirol</i>, who adopted the Emperor
<i>Maximilian</i> I.</p>

<p>XXIV. <i>Blanche Mary</i>, the second Wife of <i>Maximilian</i> I. which Princess
was the Daughter of <i>John Galeas</i> Duke of <i>Milan</i>.</p>

<p>XXV. <i>Margaret</i>, Daughter of <i>Maximilian</i> I. who was marry'd first to
<i>John</i> a Prince of <i>Spain</i>, and secondly to <i>Philibert</i> Duke of <i>Savoy</i>.</p>

<p>XXVI. <i>Cimburge</i>, Wife of <i>Ernest</i> the Archduke, and Mother to the Emperor
<i>Frederic</i> IV.</p>

<p>XXVII. <i>Charles</i> the <i>Bold</i>, Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, Father to <i>Mary</i> of
<i>Burgundy</i> who was Wife to <i>Maximilian</i> I.</p>

<p>XXVIII. <i>Philip</i>, Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, Father to <i>Charles</i> the <i>Bold</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Besides these twenty-eight Statues there are twenty three others plac'd
upon the Cornish of the Portico which separates the Nave from the Choir:
They are of Brass two Foot high, and represent those Kings and Princes
whom the Church honours as Saints.</p>

<p>I am farther to acquaint you of the Chapel of this Church, call'd the
Silver Chapel, because of the Image of the Virgin there of solid Silver as
big as the Life in the middle of the Altar, with a great many Images of
Saints all of the same Metal. The Ascent to this Chapel is by a winding
Stair-Case. Here is to be seen the stately Tomb of <i>Ferdinand</i> Archduke of
<i>Austria</i>, Count of <i>Tirol</i>, Son to the Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i> I. This
Mausoleum is under an Arch which is pretty high.
<i>Ferdinand</i>,<!--415.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
whose
Figure is of white Marble, seems to be asleep upon a Bed of black Marble
rais'd one Foot from the Ground. The whole Arch is lin'd with Marble of
various Colours, forming divers Compartments of very curious Workmanship,
where you see the Arms of the Provinces reduc'd to the Obedience of the
House of <i>Austria</i>: The different Colours are shewn by precious Stones
enchas'd in Marble, and so curiously done that the Work seems to be
enamel'd. Round the same Arch are plac'd five Bas-Reliefs, representing in
as many Pictures the memorable Actions of <i>Ferdinand</i>. Five other
Bas-Reliefs contain the Images of that Prince's Patrons, <i>viz.</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>, St. <i>Anthony</i> of <i>Padua</i>, St. <i>George</i>, St. <i>Thomas</i>, and St.
<i>Leopold</i>.</p>

<p>Near the said Tomb stands that of <i>Philippina</i> of <i>Welserin</i>, who was born
at <i>Augsburg</i>, and the Wife of the Archduke <i>Ferdinand</i>, by whom she had
two Sons, <i>Charles</i> the Margrave of <i>Burgau</i>, and <i>Andrew</i> Cardinal of
<i>Austria</i>. This <i>Mausoleum</i> is of Free-stone and has nothing remarkable
more than the following Epitaph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Ferdinandus D. G. Archidux, Dux BurgundiÆ, Comes Tirol,
Philippinæ Conjugi Charissimæ fieri curavit.</span> <span class="smcap">Obiit</span> 24 Aprilis,
1580.</div>

<p>The Franciscan who shew'd me this Chapel assur'd me that it was one of the
First-rate Chapels in the World, on account of the Indulgences which had
been annex'd to it by the Beneficence of the Popes; that it was upon a par
with the Chapel of the <i>Holy Sepulchre</i> at <i>Jerusalem</i>, with the Churches
of <i>St. John de Lateran</i>, <i>St. Mary major</i>, and <i>St. Gregory</i> at <i>Rome</i>;
and that, in fine, a Mass said in this Chapel for the Repose of a Soul
departed, was enough to deliver it out of Purgatory.</p>

<!--416.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span></p>

<p>These, Sir, are the Remarks that I made in this City, from whence I am
making ready to set out to-morrow. I expect to be well jolted all the way
to <i>Venice</i>, where to make my self amends I will take my Pleasure in a
<i>Gondola</i>. I wish with all my heart I had your Company there; we should
then have the Satisfaction of seeing a great many fine Sights together.
But for want of this Satisfaction I shall never cease to think of you; and
pray don't forget me, but believe me to be for ever, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XXV.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Venice, April</i> 27, 1730.</span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>I wrote to you from <i>Inspruc</i> the very Day before I set out from thence
for this Place, to which I arriv'd without any Misfortune. About three
quarters of a League from <i>Inspruc</i> we came among very tiresome and
disagreeable Mountains, the highest of which is call'd the <i>Brenner</i>, a
Name that the Country People gave it when they clear'd it of the Wood, and
burnt it. This Mountain is much more rugged on the side of <i>Trent</i> than
'tis towards <i>Inspruc</i>; 'tis for nine Months together cover'd with Snow,
and I found a great deal remaining on it still; yet 'tis inhabited to the
very Top. There is a Post-House, a Tavern, and a Chapel in which Mass is
only said when the
Snows<!--417.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
are melted: It produces Corn and Hay in
abundance. Near the Post-House there is a considerable Spring which at
first forms a large Basin, and then divides into two Torrents which
quickly change into Rivers, one whereof falls into the <i>Inn</i> above
<i>Inspruc</i>, and the other, after becoming navigable two Leagues from
<i>Bolsano</i>, loses itself in the <i>Adige</i> above <i>Trent</i>. The Passage of the
<i>Brenner</i> is very painful, and sometimes impracticable when it snows or
rains; so that Travellers are often oblig'd to stay several Days till the
Return of fair Weather, which is the more inconvenient because the Inns on
both Sides are of the worst sort.</p>

<p><i>Stertzingen</i> a little Town four Post-Stages from <i>Inspruc</i>, has nothing
remarkable; however I was well accommodated there. Next Day I went and
din'd at <span class="smcap">Brixen</span> an Episcopal City in an agreeable Valley, where I found
the Season very forward. The Country between <i>Brixen</i> and <i>Bolsano</i> is
extremely populous, and so manur'd that the steepest Mountains are
cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolsano</span> is a pretty Town well inhabited, and drives a considerable Trade,
having no less than four Fairs a Year. Its Situation is very agreeable, in
the middle of a fine large Valley full of Villages and Vineyards. The Air
here is much softer than in the rest of <i>Tirol</i>, and I found Trees here in
full Verdure while in the Country they were but just budded. The Vines are
very carefully watched by Men who keep Guard in Huts rais'd upon three
Poles plac'd cross-wise, and high enough to command the Vineyards.
<i>Misson</i> in his Voyage to <i>Italy</i> says, that these Huts or <i>Guerites</i> were
for lodging the Guards that are posted to hinder the Bears from eating the
Grapes. I know not who could tell him that there were any Bears in this
Country, and if there are 'tis hardly probable they would venture into a
Valley so populous as that of <i>Bolsano</i>.
The<!--418.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Wines of this Valley are the
best in all <i>Tirol</i>; but they must be drank, as must all the Wines of this
Country, the very Year of their Growth, or else they grow luscious, and
then turn crabbed.</p>

<p>The Valley of <i>Bolsano</i> which extends to <i>Trent</i> is throughout equally
agreeable; and is not incumber'd by those horrid Mountains that we were
pester'd with in the Road from <i>Inspruc</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trent</span> is celebrated for the Council formerly held there. I went to see the
Church of St. <i>Mary major</i>, where the Fathers of that Council held their
Assembly. It has nothing remarkable besides its Organs which are of too
enormous a Size for a Church, but are a very curious piece of Work; for
they not only exhibit various Sounds, but imitate Vocal Music, the Notes
of divers Birds, and the Noise of Kettle-Drums and Trumpets. The Bishop of
<i>Trent</i> is a Prince of the Empire. The See is now vacant by the Death of
the Count <i>de Wolckenstein</i> the last Bishop. The Chapter has fix'd the
Election for next <i>May</i>. A great many Travellers highly extol the Bishop's
Palace, but for my own part, I was not so fortunate as to observe any
thing in it that was worthy of Attention.</p>

<p>Throughout all <i>Tirol</i> the Common People are very ill-favour'd: Most of
the Women are disguis'd by Wens in their Throat<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, and as if that was
not enough they disfigure themselves by their Dress. The Country Women
wear Stockings which have no Feet, and are gather'd into many little Folds
from the Ancle to the Calf of the Leg: Their Shoes are exactly like those
the Men wear. Their Petticoats are exceeding short, and ty'd up almost as
high as their Breasts which are very large. With all this they have a Pair
of Stays which reaches down
to<!--419.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
their Waist, and renders them compleatly
deform'd. Instead of other Head-dress they wear a green high-crown'd Hat,
the Brims of which are let down, and is as unbecoming a part of their
Dress as any of the rest. At <i>Brixen</i> the Blood mends, the Women are
handsomer, the Men more genteel, and the People in general more civiliz'd;
tho' take 'em all together the <i>Tirolese</i> are very honest People. They are
staunch zealous Catholics, tho' they say that some of the Peasants, are
<i>Lutherans</i>. The <i>Holy Virgin</i> and St. <i>Christopher</i> are the principal
Objects of the People's Devotion: The latter is painted on all their
Houses, and the Roads are full of little Chapels of the <i>Virgin</i> who is
represented in all manner of ways. I have seen her painted in a Chapel
standing with a great Veil over her Head which she extended with her Arms
to cover the Pope, the Emperor, seven Kings, and as many Electors, who
seem to be prostrate at her Knees.</p>

<p>As I left <i>Trent</i> I began to ascend a Mountain which does not become
smooth till we reach to <i>Berschen</i> which is a Post-Stage and a half from
<i>Trent</i>. This Mountain is exceeding steep, troublesome, and tiresome, and
after 'tis pass'd, one is in a manner buried among Rocks and horrid
Mountains which seem as if they would fall on the Heads of the Travellers;
and I have been assur'd that this sometimes happens in rainy Weather, when
so many Pieces crumble off of the Rock that it requires 4 or 500 Carts to
clear the Roads. In short, all the Way till one comes within a League of
<i>Bossagno</i> a City in the State of <i>Venice</i> is full of Rocks and
Precipices; but from that Town to <i>Mestre</i> which is four Post-Stages from
it, the Country is the finest in the World; and in short, every thing is
good and pleasant except their Wine and their publick Houses. The Wine has
naturally a musty Taste, and no Body, and the Colour is like that of the
thick Wine of
<i>Bourdeaux</i>.<!--420.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
This Country so abounds in Quails that the
Post-Master of <i>Bossagno</i> assur'd me he had taken 720 in a Morning, that
he drove a great Trade with 'em, and sent some of 'em to the State of
<i>Venice</i>, and to <i>Lombardy</i>. Whether he said true, I know not, but he
shew'd me 1100 live Quails which he kept in Wicker-Cages in a great Barn
where he had hung all the Cages to Pack-Thread to keep them from Rats and
Cats.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Mestre</span> one embarks for <i>Venice</i> which is about seven Leagues from it; I
made the Voyage in a Gondola in less than an Hour and half. As I travell'd
post to <i>Mestre</i>, my Gondoliers, when I came to <i>Venice</i>, carry'd me to
the Post-Office, where I was oblig'd to tell my Name, and the Business for
which I came to <i>Venice</i>; but this is a Ceremony to which they who don't
travel post are not subject. I went and took up my Lodging at the <i>White
Lion</i>, highly rejoic'd that I could rest my self there after my Fatigue,
and that I had lost sight of the <i>Alps</i>, those horrid Mountains which no
body would chuse to live amongst but a <i>Swiss</i> or a <i>Tirolese</i>, who, as
Cardinal <i>Bentivoglio</i> justly observes in his Voyage to <i>Swisserland</i>, are
a People made for the <i>Alps</i>, and the <i>Alps</i> for them.</p>

<p>As I have been twice before at <i>Venice</i>, I serve as a
<i>Cicerone</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to
two <i>Bohemian</i> Counts whom I was acquainted with at <i>Prague</i>, and whom I
happen'd to meet with at my Quarters. As 'tis customary to do to all
Foreigners, I began with shewing them the Square of St. <i>Mark</i>, the chief
Square of <i>Venice</i>, if not of the whole World. 'Tis adorn'd by the Palace
of the <i>Doge</i>, the Church of St. <i>Mark</i>, and the <i>Procuraties</i>, or Houses
of the Procurators, and has been pav'd within these few Years
with<!--421.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
great
Squares of Free-stone. We ascended the famous Tower of St. <i>Mark</i> which is
a four-square Building, by a Stair without Steps. It was built by the Doge
<i>Domingo Morosini</i>, to serve as a Watch-Tower to Ships at Sea; and that it
might be seen a great way off he caus'd the Angel on the top of it to be
gilt; but Time the Destroyer of all Things has stripp'd off the Gold. From
this Tower one sees the whole City of <i>Venice</i>, the neighbouring Islands,
and the <i>Terra Firma</i>, which all together makes a noble Prospect.</p>

<p>We afterwards enter'd St. <i>Mark</i>'s Church, which is an Edifice of
<i>Grecian</i> Architecture, pretty dark and not very high, but after all, full
of Curiosities worthy the Attention of a Traveller. As this Church has
been describ'd with more Exactness than I can pretend to, I shall treat
very succinctly of the chief Things which it contains. The grand Portico
is so low that one must even go down some Steps to enter into the Church.
There is a Platform over it on which are plac'd four brazen Horses brought
from <i>Constantinople</i>, to which they were first carry'd from <i>Rome</i> by
<i>Constantine</i> when that Prince transferr'd the Seat of the Empire from the
one City to the other. Nothing is so magnificent and beautiful as those
Horses. They were heretofore all over gilt, but People out of mere Avarice
scrap'd off great part of the precious Metal, and all the rest is almost
worn off by Time.</p>

<p>At the Entrance of the Church on the right-hand Side there is a square
Stone which seem'd to me to be of white Marble, and is said to be a piece
of the Rock which <i>Moses</i> struck in the Wilderness, whereupon there issued
out Water. If this be really that Stone, what that Legislator did is so
much the more to be admir'd, and may be reckon'd doubly miraculous; first
in fetching Water to a Place where there was none before, and then the
<!--422.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>bringing
a quantity of it through four Holes no bigger than Pease
sufficient to quench the Thirst of so numerous a Multitude. The Pavement
of this Church is very grand, being of <i>Mosaic</i> Work exceedingly
diversify'd with Stones of various Colours, Marble and Porphyry: But the
stateliest Thing in all the Church are the Ornaments of the Altar for the
great Holidays, of which that of St. <i>Mark</i> the Patron of the Republic is
the most strictly kept. St. <i>Mark</i>'s Treasure is then all laid open, which
consists in the rich Spoils taken from the Emperors of <i>Constantinople</i>.
Every part shines with solid Gold, Pearls, and Diamonds; so that the
Temple of <i>Jerusalem</i> excepted, I believe there's not a House devoted to
God that could ever boast of so much Riches. All this Treasure is kept in
St. <i>Mark</i>'s Tower, and none of it can be taken out but in presence of one
of the Procurators, who must also be at the Altar when the Treasure is
plac'd on it, and dare not stir from it till 'tis put up safe again.</p>

<p>St. <i>Mark</i>'s Church serves as a public Chapel to the Doge, who always is
or at least ought to be attended thither by the Pope's Nuncio and the
Ambassadors; but M. <i>de Gersi</i> the <i>French</i> Ambassador, from I know not
what Punctilio of Honour, avoids being present at the same Functions with
the Count <i>de Bolagnos</i> the Emperor's Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>, whom he can't
endure to see go before him. When the Doge goes to St. <i>Mark</i>'s Church
'tis always with great Ceremony: He walks between the Pope's Nuncio and
the Emperor's Ambassador, and the other Ambassadors walk in the same Row
according to the Rank of their Masters. They are preceded by six Trumpets,
and six Banners are born before the Doge together with a Chair or Stool of
State,<!--423.png--><span class="pagenum">398</span>
there being no Back to it, and a Cushion of Gold Brocade. The
Prince is dress'd in a long Robe of Gold Brocade also lin'd and fac'd with
Ermin. The Senators follow him in Robes of red Damask, walking two and
two. He is receiv'd at the Entrance of the Church by the Clergy of St.
<i>Mark</i> who bring him Holy Water and Incense, which the Ambassadors receive
after him. His Serenity and the Ambassadors fall on their Knees in the
middle of the Nave, and then repeat the Prayers of <i>Domine salvum fac
Principem nostrum</i>. Afterwards the Doge goes and places himself at the End
of the Choir on the right Hand as we go in, and sits in the first upper
Row of the Canons with the Pope's Nuncio on his Right and the Emperor's
Ambassador on the Right of the Nuncio, and so on with the rest. The Doge
does not sit down 'till the Senators are all enter'd, who, as they pass by
his Serenity, make him a profound Obeisance, to which the Doge makes no
manner of return. When every body is seated, the Doge accompany'd by the
Ambassadors advances towards the Altar, the Nuncio strikes up High Mass
and says the Overture, to which the Doge answers. After this, the Doge and
the Ambassadors return to their Places, and the Prelate of St. <i>Mark</i> who
is in waiting, continues the Office.</p>

<p>After the Mass is over, the Doge returns to his Palace attended by the
same Train that accompanied him to Church. When he has ascended the grand
Stair-case of his Palace he seats himself in an Arm-Chair which is plac'd
over-against the Stair-case. After he has sate a few Moments, he dismisses
the Ambassadors and the other Persons of his Retinue, and retires to his
Apartment.</p>

<p>Next to St. <i>Mark</i>'s Church is the Doge's Palace, a vast Building, of
which you will find a large Account in <i>Misson</i>'s Travels.</p>

<!--424.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span></p>

<p>The present Doge is <i>Aloisio Mocenigo</i><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, a Prince as much to be
respected for his Merit as for his Dignity. He is a Gentleman of great
Sagacity, talks well, is very polite, and has infinitely more Generosity
than is ascribed to those of his Country. He is a handsome Man, and has a
noble Aspect that is improv'd by his white Locks of Hair which render him
venerable. Before he was advanc'd to be a Doge, which was in 1722, he
serv'd the Republic with distinction in quality of Generalissimo. The vain
Honours which this new Dignity has procur'd him have not puff'd him up,
and he seems to think them rather a Burden than a Pleasure. Before he came
to be Doge he was the most sociable Nobleman at <i>Venice</i>, and he now sees
more Company than ever his Predecessors did. He masks himself at publick
Rejoicings, goes out every Night in a common Gondola without Guard or
Retinue, and diverts himself at his Brother's. He has sometimes too been
upon <i>Terra Firma</i>, not valuing it tho' he lost for a while all the
Honours annexed to his Dignity as Doge; for you know that this Character
does not go beyond the Lakes. He is oblig'd to be present at all the
public Ceremonies, tho' very much against his Inclination and Temper,
which is far more uniform than that of the other <i>Italians</i>.</p>

<p>The Ceremony in which he shines with the greatest Lustre, is that of
marrying the Sea, which without dispute is one of the finest Shews in all
the World. 'Tis perform'd on <i>Ascension-Day</i>, when the Doge, the
Ambassadors, and the Senate ride out into the <i>Adriatic</i> on board a Vessel
call'd the <i>Bucentaur</i>, attended by the State-Gondolas of the Ambassadors
gilded, with a vast number of other Gondolas and Galleasses which surround
the <i>Bucentaur</i>, the most stately Vessel that was ever built, and more
magnificent than all that History
(or<!--425.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
even Romance) tells us of the
sumptuous Vessel of <i>Cleopatra</i>. When the Doge goes on board the
<i>Bucentaur</i> he is saluted by the great Guns from the Galleys, the Men of
War, and the Merchant-Ships in the Harbour; and while he performs the
Ceremony of marrying the Sea by throwing in a Ring to denote the
Sovereignty of the Republic over the Gulph, there's nothing heard but
Kettle-Drums, Trumpets, and Concerts of Music, with the loud Acclamations
of the People.</p>

<p>His Serene Highness marries two other Wives whom he maintains with as
little Trouble as the Sea. They are the Abbesses of the Convents of the
<i>Virgin</i> and St. <i>Daniel</i>. This Ceremony is perform'd upon St. <i>Philip</i>'s
Day, when the Doge in a Galeass accompany'd by the Ambassadors and the
Senate, repairs with a great Train to those Convents which are situate on
the Shore behind the Arsenal. The Prelate who officiates for the Day
receives him at the Entrance of the Church, brings him the Holy Water, and
conducts him to a Place prepared for him in the Choir where he assists at
High Mass. Then he repairs to the Grate, in which there's a large Opening
where the Lady Abbess appears with her Nuns. The Abbess addressing herself
to the Doge intreats him to continue the Favour of his Protection to
herself and the Nuns; to which the Doge returns answer, that she and all
the Convent may depend upon his Good-Will. Then he turns about and walks
on foot to the Convent of St. <i>Daniel</i>, where his Reception and
Transaction are the same as at the Convent of the <i>Virgin</i>. These two
Convents have very singular Privileges. The Abbesses have the
Crosier-Staff, and both they and their Nuns depend solely upon the Doge,
and not at all upon the Pope or the Court of <i>Rome</i> either in Spirituals
or Temporals. They have good Revenues and live as much as can be at their
Ease.
The<!--426.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Dress of these Nuns is rather gay than modest. Like the Nuns at
<i>Strasbourg</i> they wear their Hair in Tresses: Their Petticoats are so
short that you may see their Ancles; and instead of Stays they wear
Jackets with short Skirts, which are very becoming to those that are of a
good Shape. Their Necks are quite bare, only when they go into the Choir
they cover them with Veils of fine white Wool, which trail on the ground.
These Nuns are the Daughters of the Nobles, and enjoy great Liberty, more
than I believe they have under their Father's Roof.</p>

<p>The Festival of St. <i>Mark</i> is always celebrated with very great Solemnity.
On the Day preceding, the Doge accompany'd by the Ambassadors repairs with
a great Train to St. <i>Mark</i>'s Church, where he assists at the Vespers.
Next Day the Confraternities, who are nine in number, meet at the Ducal
Palace, accompany the Doge to Church in Procession, and are present at
High Mass. After this the Doge returns to his Palace, and the Brotherhoods
go round the Square. Each Society has magnificent Images, and two Canopies
richly embroider'd with Gold and Silver; whose Poles or Supporters are of
solid Silver. The Procession is clos'd by a Man dress'd in a Gown of red
Damask, carrying a Pole with a moving Wheel at the end of it; which serves
to support a gilt Lion surrounded with Laurel Branches, and little
Standards of divers Colours. The Lion turns round incessantly, and the Man
who carries it makes him leap, and play a hundred Gambols: He is
surrounded with a Multitude of People, who cry out, God bless St. <i>Mark</i>.
This Sight, how ridiculous soever, is nevertheless amusing, draws
abundance of the Nobility to the Square, and on that Day every body is
mask'd. After the Procession is over, the Maskers go to see the Doge's
Table, who
entertains<!--427.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
the Ambassadors and the Senate at Dinner, on a
Table in form of a Horse-shoe; which is extravagantly adorn'd with
Kickshaws, and Machines made of Starch, which are here call'd <i>Triumphs</i>.
Nothing of the kind can be better executed, or more magnificent. As there
is a great Apprehension of a Croud, all the Maskers are turn'd away at
Dinner-time. They keep on their Masks all day long; and after Dinner all
the Nobility, or to speak more properly, the whole City of <i>Venice</i>
appears mask'd upon the Square of St. <i>Mark</i>; and indeed, for one who
never saw it before, 'tis a remarkable fine Shew. What surpriz'd me, and
if I may say it, made me laugh, was to see all the Maskers fall on their
Knees at the Sound of the <i>Angelus</i>; you wou'd swear every body was in
Rapture, yet every thing that goes before and that follows the Stroke of
the Bell is not the most devout.</p>

<p>The Day after St. <i>Mark</i>'s we had another publick Shew, and by consequence
a fresh occasion for the <i>Venetians</i> to masquerade it. That was the
Election which the Fishermen, who are here call'd the <i>Nicolotti</i>, made of
a Chief, who bears the Title of the Doge of the <i>Nicolotti</i>. Their Choice
fell this Bout upon a Gondolier belonging to the noble <i>Giustiniani</i>.
After the Election he was conducted to an Audience of the Doge of
<i>Venice</i>, dress'd in a Robe of red Sattin, and otherwise accoutred like a
Jackpudding. He was preceded by a great Mob of Pipers, Hautboys, and
Fishermen. Just before him was carry'd a red Flag, with the Effigies of
St. <i>Mark</i>. The Doge receiv'd him sitting on his Throne, and attended by
the Council. The Complement of the Doge of the Fishermen was made with
great Gravity, and answer'd by the Doge of the Republick in few Words;
which done, he return'd in the same Order that
he<!--428.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
came. This sham Doge
has authority over all the Fishermen, is their Judge, gives them Licence
to fish, and takes care that the City be well supplied with that sort of
Provision. 'Tis said that this Office, which is for Life, is worth above
1000 Crowns <i>per Annum</i>. He had formerly the Privilege of commanding in a
certain Quarter of the City, and assisted at all the Ceremonies where the
Doge was present: He even accompany'd that Prince on board the
<i>Bucentaur</i>, and had Precedency of all the Ambassadors; but they have lost
that Right since, upon what occasion I know not, they gave up the
Precedency to an Ambassador from the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Patriarch of <i>Venice</i> is the second Person in the State. The present
Patriarch is of the Family of <i>Gradenigo</i>. The Authority of this Prelate
is so stinted, that he only nominates to two or three Benefices. The
Inhabitants of every Parish chuse their Parsons, which is always attended
with Intriguing; for their Livings being very lucrative, have great
Interest made for them. The Patriot has a Privilege of having a Gondola
painted Purple and Gold, with a Roof or Covering of Red Velvet; but this
Gondola must not exceed a certain Degree of Magnificence. You know that
the Gondolas of private Men must be black, and that none but Ambassadors
have the Privilege of having theirs gilded.</p>

<p>Tho' the Churches of <i>Venice</i> have been sufficiently describ'd, I cannot
help saying something of those that I thought the most remarkable. Without
doubt the Front of the Church of the bare-footed <i>Carmelites</i>, situate
upon the Great Canal, is the most magnificent, not only of <i>Venice</i>, but
perhaps of <i>Europe</i>; as well with regard to the Proportions of
Architecture that have been carefully observ'd, as with regard to the
Fineness of the Marble, white
as<!--429.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Alabaster, with which this beautiful
Front is wholly embellish'd. The Inside of this Church is extremely
magnificent. The Roof is richly gilded, and curiously painted. The Walls
are fac'd with Marble Pilasters; the Floor is of Stones inlaid with
various Colours, and the Altars are exceeding stately: But of all these
different things there seems to be too great a number, so that I could
wish many of the Ornaments had been spar'd; for a noble Simplicity wou'd
have look'd much better.</p>

<p>This sort of Simplicity is conspicuous in the Church of St. <i>George</i>, one
of the biggest in <i>Venice</i>, the Architecture of which is surprizing. A
Convent belongs to it, which for Magnificence and Regularity surpasses
many Sovereign Palaces. The great Stair-Case is a fine piece of
Architecture, and wou'd become a King's Palace much better than a Convent.
This House has two noble Cloysters planted with Orange-Trees, a couple of
spacious Courts, and two large Gardens well cultivated, which have
Terrasses from whence there is a Prospect of the Sea, and the neighbouring
Islands.</p>

<p>The Capuchins, whose Churches are very plain every where else, have a very
noble one here, which is called <i>Al Redemptore</i>. It was built by order of
the Republic to discharge a Vow they had made in the time of a Plague. The
honest Capuchin who shew'd me the Church, made me take special notice of a
Crucifix of Brass over the high Altar, whereon our Saviour is represented
expiring, with his Head leaning on his right Shoulder. My Guide assur'd me
that when the Crucifix was plac'd in the Church the Head of our Lord's
Image was erect, but that it fell afterwards into its present Posture.</p>

<p>There are other Churches worth seeing, were it only for the stately Tombs
of the most distinguish'd Families of the Republic. Such is the Tomb of
the noble Family of <i>Cornaro</i>, in the Church of
the<!--430.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
<i>Cajetans</i>, where are
the Marble Effigies of eight Cardinals, and four Doges descended from that
Family. In the Churches of St. <i>Paul</i> and St. <i>John</i> are Pictures very
much esteem'd by the <i>Connoisseurs</i>, and there's the sumptuous Tomb of the
<i>Valerios</i>, where the Father, the Mother, with the Son, are carv'd in
their natural Proportion in Marble, apparell'd in the Habit of the Doge
and Dogess.</p>

<p>Before I have done with the Churches, I think I ought to give you some
account of that of the <i>Jesuits</i>; the Front whereof is of noble
Architecture, well disposed, and the Ornaments not too much crouded; but
the Decoration of the Inside is really grand. Nothing can be richer than
the Choir, and the high Altar. The Choir consists of a spacious Dome
supported by four large Pillars of white Marble, lin'd with great
Flower-pieces of old green Marble. The Roof is painted and gilt. The high
Altar, which is all of Marble, is a Pavilion or Dome supported by ten
Columns wreath'd of the ancient <i>Greek</i> Marble. The Tabernacle is of
Alabaster, incrustated with <i>Lapis-Lazuli</i>. To all this rich Work are
added two Angels in their natural Proportion, over which are the Effigies
of God the Father, and God the Son. The five Steps leading to the Altar
are of green Marble, incrustated with old yellow Marble so artfully that
this Work would easily be taken for a Piece of <i>Persian</i> Tapestry. The
Pulpit and the Balustrade, which separates the Nave from the Choir, are of
Marble, and perfectly answerable to the Magnificence of the whole Church.</p>

<p>I now proceed to the Arsenal, so much celebrated in <i>Europe</i>, perhaps more
for what it has been than what it is at present. Three Nobles have the
Management or Custody of it, who relieve one another every Week. He that
is in waiting must visit the Posts in the Night-time; and the Centinels
<!--431.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>are
oblig'd each to ring a Bell every Hour, that the Officer upon Guard
may know they are at their Posts. No body can see the Arsenal without
Leave of the Nobleman in waiting, who never refuses it to Persons of Rank.
The first thing I was shew'd were four Rooms full of Arms necessary for
the Marines, where are also kept the Cuirasses of those Generals who have
most distinguish'd themselves in the Service of the Republic; but they are
all full of Dust. Then I was shewed the Magazine of Anchors, and the
Cellar to which the Workmen of the Arsenal go when they please to a
Fountain of Wine and Water mix'd. As much diluted as this Wine is, 'tis
said that there's no less spent here every Year than amounts to 74000
Crowns. This is an Endowment which was settled by one <i>Cornaro</i> Queen of
<i>Cyprus</i>, for the Relief of the Workmen. Near this Cellar are the Forges,
of which there are twelve; but there are only two actually at work. The
Rope-Yard just by it, is 410 Paces in length, and serves at the same time
for a Warehouse of Hemp, of which I did not see any great Quantity. In
another Court there were a great many Cannon, both Iron and Brass, a Room
full of Bullets, a Magazine of Cordage, a Timber-Yard, and three great
Rooms full of Arms for the Foot Soldiers. There was another that serv'd as
an Arsenal for the Horse, but 'twas lately burnt down by the Carelessness
of a Centinel. The Dock for building and refitting of Ships forms a
separate Court, in the midst of which there's a great Bason that
communicates with the Sea, and is encompass'd with twenty six Sheds
cover'd over, which contain as many Ships, Galleys, and Galleasses. The
latter are Machines of a terrible Size, which have a sort of Battery at
both ends. My Guide assur'd me that a <i>Venetian</i> Galleass was not afraid
of twenty five <i>Turkish</i> Galleys: This may be; but
I<!--432.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
wou'd venture a
Wager on the side of the Infidels. In this same Dock are the Prowes of
twelve <i>Turkish</i> Galleys taken at the famous Battle of <i>Lepanto</i>. But the
most noble thing in all this Dock, is the <i>Bucentaur</i>, which went out of
Port for the first time in the Year 1728. This superb Vessel was built by
<i>Antonio Corradini</i>; and is so well design'd, and the Ornaments of
Sculpture, of which there's a great number, so well plac'd, that every
thing is easily distinguish'd, and strikes with Amazement. 'Tis gilded
down to the Water-edge, and 'tis said that the Expence of it amounted to
70000 Sequins. The Deck is cover'd from Head to Stern with Crimson-Velvet,
bedaub'd with a broad Lace, and Gold Fringes. And the inside if possible
is more magnificent than the Outside. There's a great Room the length of
the Ship, where the Doge sits on a Throne, and the Ambassadors and
Senators on Seats like those of the Canons in the Choir. The Cieling
consists of Bas-reliefs in divers Compartments intirely gilt. The Floor is
of Walnut-tree, incrusted with Ebony-Wood and Mother of Pearl. The Rowers
who sit in the Hold of the Ship are all of one Livery, and their Oars
gilt, which makes a very fine Sight when all hands strike together.</p>

<p>You know that the <i>Bucentaur</i> never goes out but once a-year, upon
Ascension-day, when the Captain who then commands must take an Oath before
he stirs out of the Harbour, that he will bring her back again into the
Arsenal. He carries nothing aboard of his own, for unless the Weather be
very fair indeed, the Ceremony is put off to another day. They build a new
<i>Bucentaur</i> every hundred Years, and the old ones are laid up till they
rot.</p>

<p>I just now hear that the Post is going off, so that I am oblig'd to defer
what I have farther to say of <i>Venice</i> till the next. I shall be
infinitely
pleas'd<!--433.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
if I can satisfy your Curiosity, and much more if I
can prove to you that no body has a more profound Veneration for you than
I, <i>Who am</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Venice, May 15, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>The Common-wealth keeps twelve Galleys in pay, and twenty Men of War. The
<i>Capitana</i> Galley, call'd the <i>Fusta</i>, never goes out of the Great Canal,
but is continually at Anchor before the Square of St. <i>Mark</i>. There's
commonly four Galleys and as many Men of War in the <i>Levant</i>. Others lie
at Anchor in the Canal of <i>Zueca</i>, which were lately drawn out of the
Arsenal, because for want of Water the Ships receive Damage. The Power of
the Republic consists chiefly in its Maritime Force. It maintains very few
Land Forces, and those they have are all kept at <i>Corfou</i>, which is the
Rampart of <i>Venice</i>, and the Defence of the Gulph; the Preservation of
which is owing to the Count <i>de Schulemburg</i>, General in chief of the
Republic; for in the last War when the <i>Turks</i> attempted to take it, 'twas
he that oblig'd them to raise the Siege: And the Republic in
acknowledgment of this important Service caus'd his Statue on Horseback to
be erected in the Square of the Old Castle of <i>Corfou</i>; and settled a
Pension upon him of 5000 Crowns a-year for his Life, besides his ordinary
Salary.</p>

<p>'Tis certain that <i>Venice</i> has suffer'd a Decay both of Power and
Commerce. The <i>Turks</i> have
taken<!--434.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
the <i>Morea</i> from her; she has little or
nothing left in the <i>Levant</i>; and as to her Places in the <i>Terra Firma</i>
they are poor, depopulated, and meanly fortified. One of the main
Securities of <i>Venice</i> is her Lakes; but for some Years past they begin to
thicken so by the Mud and Dirt brought by the Rivers which fall into the
Gulph, as in time must prove to the very great Detriment of <i>Venice</i>,
because Ships which us'd formerly to go in or out with ease, can only go
out now by the help of a Canal which has been cut for the purpose. This
Inconvenience might have formerly been prevented for a trifle of Expence,
whereas now 'tis past all remedy.</p>

<p>The Powers of which the <i>Venetians</i> ought to be most jealous, are the
<i>Turks</i> and the Emperor, in whose Dominions they are in a manner inclos'd.
The Great Duke of <i>Tuscany</i> and the Duke of <i>Parma</i> were formerly Powers
which were of little or no Terror to the Republic; but if those Dominions
shou'd ever come under the Sovereignty of <i>Don Carlos</i>, the political
System of <i>Italy</i> will be very much alter'd, and the <i>Venetians</i> will in
all probability be oblig'd to keep fair with him. The Republic has for a
long time observ'd an exact Neutrality in the Quarrels among the Princes
of Christendom, perhaps because it knows not for which side to determine
itself; for tho' the Senate hates the <i>Spaniards</i>, and cannot forget the
famous Conspiracy of the Marquiss <i>de Bedmar</i> the Catholic King's
Ambassador; they don't much like either the <i>Germans</i> or <i>French</i>, whose
Power gives them Umbrage. And I believe, were it possible for the
<i>Venetians</i> to hurt those three Powers at the same time, we shou'd quickly
see their Republic rouze itself from that Lethargy in which it's profound
State-Policy has doz'd it.</p>

<p>Since the <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i> became Masters of the Commerce of
<i>Europe</i>, the Trade of <i>Venice</i> is as
much<!--435.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
decay'd as its Power; and
their Manufactures are sunk extremely. The <i>Venetians</i> heretofore
furnished almost all <i>Europe</i> with Cloth; their Looking-Glasses, and those
for Drinking, were also in great vogue, but those Manufactures are since
transplanted into other Countries, so that <i>Venice</i> scarce furnishes any
more than <i>Italy</i>. 'Tis worth while however to go and see the Glass-House
where they work Night and Day, except in <i>August</i> and <i>September</i>, when
the Heats are too violent. 'Tis certain the Drinking-Glasses made here are
much stronger than any other, but as they are blown they are not near so
substantial as the Glass that is run; however they require less Labour,
and have the Advantage when they are broke of being melted again; the
Matter of which they are composed being much more flexible than that of
the run Glass.</p>

<p>The Nobles of <i>Venice</i> are Slaves to Policy, Diffidence, and Suspicion;
and Ambassadors are much more so, whom every one shuns as suspected
Persons, and whom a Foreigner can scarce talk to without renouncing his
Correspondence with the Nobles. An Ambassador is oblig'd to confine
himself to his own Family, or else to amuse himself in the Company of
Foreigners, of whom there is always a good number in this City; for no
Nobleman dare visit him without the express leave of the Senate, who now
indeed grant it much more freely than they did formerly.</p>

<p>Customs are alter'd here in very many things. 'Twas formerly a Crime to
see a Woman in private, and a Foreigner did not dare to run the Venture;
but now the case is quite different, for there are several Houses of
Quality where I am indulg'd, and am often <i>tête a tête</i> with the Mistress
of the House, without any more notice taken of me than if I were in
<i>France</i>, where Ease and Freedom
are<!--436.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
so much boasted. The Ladies are
great Visiters, and have Assemblies every Night, to which they repair
alone in their Gondola's without any other Attendance but a Valet de
Chambre, who serves as their Gentleman-Usher. They are mask'd at all
public Performances, and go where they have a mind to it. This easy access
to the Ladies contributes not a little to make my Stay in this City
agreeable. I own to you that I am infinitely charm'd with it; there are a
thousand Things here that please me, and were I to chuse any City in
<i>Italy</i> to live in, 'twould certainly be this, where People enjoy entire
Liberty, provided they don't meddle with the State and its Government,
which after all too, I don't think a Foreigner has much to do with. Here
one is in the Centre of civil Pleasures and Debauchery. God is as
exemplarily serv'd here as in any Place whatsoever. Few Nations observe
the Externals of Religion better than the <i>Italians</i> in general and the
<i>Venetians</i> in particular, of whom it may be said that they spend one half
of their time in committing Sin, and the other half in begging God's
pardon.</p>

<p>Masquerades are more in fashion here than elsewhere. People go in Masks to
take the Air, as well as to Plays and Balls; and 'tis the favourite
Pleasure both of the Grandees and the Commonalty. This gives rise to many
Adventures, and sometimes one makes Acquaintance under a Mask which would
be impracticable perhaps, were not such Disguises in Fashion. I remember
that the first time I was here I struck up an Acquaintance in the Square
of St. <i>Mark</i> with two of the first-rate Ladies of this Country. They were
mask'd, and I was in a Scarlet Domino embroider'd with Silver, which being
a Habit that had been seldom seen here, drew the Eyes of all the Company
in the Square upon me, and in particular of two Ladies, one of whom
twitching<!--437.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
me by the Sleeve, said to me, 'Sir, I and the Lady here, my
Friend, fancy by your Air which outstrips our Gentlemen, that you are a
Foreigner, and we are inclin'd to think that you are no mean Person. We
should be glad of your Conversation, and you will do us a Pleasure to take
a turn with us round the Square.&mdash;You do me too much Honour, fair Lady
(said I, walking on) and what you tell me of my Appearance pleases me the
more because you are both the compleatest Ladies in the Place. As you
guess by my Habit that I am not a common Person, your Air persuades me
that I have the Honour to speak to Ladies of Quality.&mdash;You are not
mistaken (said the same Lady to me) this Lady my Companion is Madame
<i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> and I am the Wife of Mr. <i>C&mdash;&mdash;</i>. You find (continu'd she) that
our Names are pretty well known in <i>Venice</i>. Now, after having told you
who we are, may we presume to ask who you are?' I gratify'd their
Curiosity by pulling off my Mask, which I thought a Compliment due to
their Quality. I had scarce told my Name, when the Lady who had not yet
spoke one Word, said to me, 'You are not so much a Stranger among us as
you imagine; your Name is very well known to me, and the late Madame
<i>Duhamel</i>, your Aunt, whose<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Husband was Commander in chief of our
Forces, was one of my most intimate Friends, and she often told me how
much she wish'd to see you here; but 'twas a Comfort she did not live to
enjoy. She went with her Husband to <i>Corfou</i>, where he died not without
Suspicion of Poison; for he was accus'd of being too great a <i>Frenchman</i>;
and your Aunt who was return'd from <i>Corfou</i> with a
Design<!--438.png--><span class="pagenum">413</span>
to go and
spend the Remainder of her Days at <i>Berlin</i>, died as she was performing
Quarentine in our Port. You caus'd her Body to be remov'd to <i>Berlin</i>, and
you was one of her Heirs; and, tho' I don't mention it to make a Merit of
it, I must tell you that you are oblig'd to me for it, since I pleaded for
you against a very great number of M. <i>Duhamel</i>'s Relations. My Love to
your Aunt put me upon engaging Mr. <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> to espouse your Interest, which
he promoted with Success, and prevail'd on the Senate to prefer the
Recommendations of the King of <i>Prussia</i> and the Elector of <i>Hanover</i> who
both protected you, before the Instances made by the <i>French</i> Ambassador
in the Name of the King his Master, in favour of Messieurs <i>Duhamel</i>. I
was infinitely pleas'd (continu'd Madame <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i>) that I had an
Opportunity of serving you, and you may depend upon it that Mr. <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i>
and I shall ever interest our selves heartily for all that belong to our
deceased Friend.' I made answer to Madame <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> in Terms suitable to her
obliging Expressions, and crav'd her Permission to pay my respects to her
at her House. She answer'd me very civilly that she would send her Husband
to me, and that then she should be glad to see me at her House. Next
Morning as I was ready to go out, and wait upon Mr. <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> to whom I
thought I ow'd a Visit after the Civilities I had receiv'd from his Wife,
I was told that he was at my Door and desir'd to speak with me. I went and
receiv'd him, and found him every whit as polite as his Lady. He offer'd
to shew me the Curiosities of <i>Venice</i> till his Wife was stirring. We went
and saw several Churches, after which he conducted me to his House where I
found Madame <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> who receiv'd me with all the Civility possible. She
was a Woman who tho' forty Years of Age shew'd that she
had<!--439.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
been a very
beautiful Lady in her time. Madame <i>C&mdash;&mdash;</i> happen'd to be in her Company,
with whom she had been the Day before in the Square of St. <i>Mark</i>. I never
saw a more beautiful Lady, or that had a nobler Carriage. She was not yet
twenty Years of Age, but had been marry'd five Years to a Man, who tho'
the most ill-favour'd of his Sex had a most amiable Behaviour. I fell in
love with Madame <i>C&mdash;&mdash;</i> as soon as ever I saw her, and when I beheld her
Husband, I had Presumption enough to believe that my Application to the
Lady would not be disagreeable. But I soon perceiv'd that she was not a
Woman for my turn; she quickly depriv'd me of all Hopes of Success; and I
no sooner saw those Hopes vanish'd, which are the only Support of Lovers,
but I dropp'd my Amour. I had another in view which was attended with
better Success: M. <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> carry'd me to a Country-House of his towards
<i>Padua</i>, and I don't know where I was ever more agreeably entertain'd in
my whole Life. 'Tis at these Country Seats one sees the <i>Venetians</i> in
Perfection, who are quite another sort of People here than in the City;
for here they put off that grave serious Air which they affect in Town,
and are quite sociable, civil, courteous, and live with more splendor. As
these Country-Houses are near one another, the Gentlemen to whom they
belong visit each other very much, and are almost always together; but at
<i>Venice</i> they live with more Restraint.</p>

<p>I am in some doubt whether I should reckon the Music of the <i>Venetian</i>
Churches in the number of its Pleasures; but upon the whole, I think I
ought, because certainly their Churches are frequented more to please the
Ear, than for real Devotion. The Church of <i>la Pieta</i> which belongs to the
Nuns who know no other Father but Love, is most frequented. These Nuns are
enter'd very young, and are
taught<!--440.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Music, and to play on all sorts of
Instruments, in which some of 'em are excellent Performers. <i>Apollonia</i>
actually passes for the finest Singer, and <i>Anna-Maria</i>'s for the first
Violin in <i>Italy</i>. The Concourse of People to this Church on Sundays and
Holidays is extraordinary. 'Tis the Rendezvous of all the Coquettes in
<i>Venice</i>, and such as are fond of Intrigues have here both their Hands and
Hearts full. Not many Days after my Arrival in this City I was at this
very Church, where was a vast Audience, and the finest of Music. As I was
going out, a Woman who hid her Face accosted me, saying, there was a Lady
in a Gondola who desir'd to speak with me. Tho' this smelt strong of an
Adventure, which I was never very fond of, I however went along with the
Woman; and really, not above ten Paces from the Spot I found a Gondola, in
which was a Lady whom I knew to be the Daughter of the unfortunate Baron
<i>de H&mdash;&mdash;</i> of whose tragical Catastrophe you have heard. I own it mov'd my
Compassion, as well as Sorrow, to see before my Eyes a young Lady of Rank
in a strange Country and in such a Situation as made me surmise that she
was in a bad Way. But it even touch'd me to the quick, when after having
made her Apology to me for having sent for me, she said to me with a Voice
interrupted with Sighs, 'For God's sake tell me what's become of my poor
Father; is he still living? He has been the Cause of his own Unhappiness
and mine too; he has plung'd me into an Abyss of Woe, but he is still my
Father: Nothing can make me forget the Duty I owe him; I should be glad
even to lay down my Life to relieve his Misfortunes.' I told her that I
had not been at <i>Berlin</i> for a long time; that I had not kept up a
Correspondence there with any body, and that consequently I could not tell
her any News of her Father. I knew at the same time that he died in
<!--441.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>Prison
at <i>Spandaw</i>; but I was loth to be the Messenger of such bad News
to a Person who seem'd to be already too much afflicted. 'I did not know
you were at <i>Venice</i> (reply'd Madamoiselle <i>de H&mdash;&mdash;</i>) or I should have
sought an Opportunity to speak with you. I saw you at the Church of <i>la
Pieta</i>, and the sight of you call'd my Misfortunes fresh to my Memory, as
well as the sad Catastrophe of your old Friend my Father. I could not
refrain shedding Tears, and the Remembrance of my Disgrace has eclips'd
the Pleasure I take in seeing you.' I endeavour'd to assuage her Grief,
and to calm her ruffled Soul; and therefore I went with her to her House,
and when I saw her a little compos'd I ask'd her questions about her state
of Life, and desir'd her to tell me how she had pass'd her time since she
left <i>Berlin</i>. She answer'd me in every Point with a great deal of Honesty
and Simplicity. 'After the Execution of that Sentence (said she) which
degraded my Father from Nobility and Honour, and set him on a level with
the basest Scoundrels, I had not the Courage to stay at <i>Berlin</i>. I went
to <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> to find out Madame <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i> my Aunt from whom I hoped to meet
with Protection; but I soon experienc'd that the Unfortunate have no
Relations. My Aunt would not give me House-room, and sent a Confident of
her's to tell me that she advis'd me to be gone from <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> or else to
change my Name and not to call me her Cousin, unless I had a Desire to be
confin'd. But alas! I would then have taken it as a Favour if my Aunt had
shut me up; for I was in extreme Want, and knew not what would become of
me. I lodg'd at an Inn where I got my Living by making of Linnen and
Washing, when a good likely young Man came and took up his Quarters in the
very same House, who immediately struck up an Acquaintance with me. I know
not what he
saw<!--442.png--><span class="pagenum">417</span>
in me to charm him, for I did nothing but cry all the day
long. Mean time he talk'd to me of Love, and gave me so many
Demonstrations of his flaming Passion that I found he was really smitten
with me. To tell you the whole Truth, I was not long insensible of the
same Passion. He even offer'd to marry me, which, since he would not be
deny'd, I consented to. He told me that he was an Officer in the Emperor's
Service, and a Native of <i>Lubeck</i>, and that he was come hither to take
possession of an Estate fallen to him by Inheritance. I took what he said
to be true because he was handsomely equipp'd, and had his Pockets well
lin'd. In short, I was smitten with him, and thought I should be very
happy in taking him for my Husband. Not many Days after our Marriage, he
told me that he must needs set out for <i>Hungary</i> where the Regiment was
quarter'd, whereof he said he was a Lieutenant, and that consequently I
must make ready to go with him.&mdash;We set out from <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> and arriv'd
happily at <i>Vienna</i>. It was in that very City that my Husband, who till
then behav'd well towards me, and whose Conduct had been very regular,
chang'd all on a sudden to the reverse. He spent the whole Day in
Gaming-Houses, and the Night in Debauchery. Sometimes he never once came
home for four or five Days together, and when he did, 'twas only to insult
me, and to upbraid me with the misfortune of my Father, which I discover'd
to him before Marriage, for fear he should reproach me one time or other
with having deceiv'd him. He told me that I was a Disgrace to him, that
his Colonel had broke him for marrying me, and that I was the Author of
his Ruin. I try'd to pacify him, and spar'd no Pains nor Complaisance for
it, but all to no purpose. I heard that my Husband was desperately in love
with a
common<!--443.png--><span class="pagenum">418</span>
Prostitute, that he had ruin'd himself for her sake; and in
a little time he was oblig'd to sell the very Clothes off his back. He had
contracted Debts, and expecting every day to be arrested by his Creditors,
he left <i>Vienna</i> privately, abandoning me to the most dreadful Despair.
'Twas eight Months before I heard a Word of him. At last I came to know
that he was here at <i>Venice</i>, and I resolv'd to find him out. Madame the
Countess of <i>W&mdash;&mdash;</i> who had generously assisted me, fitted me out for the
Journey, but when I came hither I did not find my Husband, who I heard was
at <i>Padua</i>. I was making my self ready to follow him thither, when I heard
the News that he was kill'd by a Student with whom he had a Quarrel at
Gaming. His Death fill'd up the Measure of my Sorrow. I found my self
quite a Stranger here without Friends or Subsistence. I endeavour'd, but
in vain, to get my Living by my Labour, as I had done at <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> but I
found so little to do that 'twas impossible for me to hold out long; and I
must undoubtedly have sunk under my Misery if it had not been for the
noble <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i> who out of Pity to my Condition reliev'd me six Years ago by
granting me a Pension: But how happy should I be if I could live without
it, and retire for ever to some religious Foundation!' Here the
unfortunate <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> concluded her Narrative. I sifted her Sentiments about
Religion: I knew she had been educated in the <i>Lutheran</i>, but she
express'd her Inclination to embrace the Catholic Religion, and also to
turn Nun. I promis'd to serve her all that lay in my power, and that same
Evening I spoke to Madame <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> who promis'd me to enter her into Orders
as soon as she was turn'd Catholic. A Jesuit who has had the tutoring of
her for near a Month gives us Hopes that she will instantly be qualify'd
to take the Veil. She seems
to<!--444.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
me to be very eager for it. A few days ago
I acquainted her with her Father's Death, with which she seem'd very much
affected, but at the same time she express'd her Submission to the Decrees
of Providence, and told me her Misfortunes with so much Resignation, that
I have Reason to think she will be very happy in the Retirement which she
is about to embrace. If this be the Case, I shall think my self very
fortunate in having contributed by my Advice to her Tranquillity. Heaven
grant her Prayers may prevail that I my self may put those Lessons in
practice which I have taught her, as to the Necessity of Conversion.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Sir, this long Digression. As you knew the unfortunate <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i>
in his Prosperity, and as you are also inform'd of his Disgrace, I thought
you would not be sorry to hear of the Fate of his Daughter. I now resume
my Remarks on <i>Venice</i>.</p>

<p>Two Days ago I went to see the <i>Scuola St. Rocco</i>, which are Rooms where
the Fraternities of that Saint meet, in which are Pictures done by the
greatest Masters, particularly one in the great Room below, which is the
Picture of the <i>Annunciation</i> done by <i>Tintoret</i>, a Piece highly esteem'd.
This Picture is, without Contradiction, one of the finest and most
affecting Paintings at <i>Venice</i>, because of the lively Expressions of
Surprise, Admiration, and Joy which appear in the <i>Virgin's</i> Face. She is
sitting in her Chamber, which the skilful Painter has represented as a
plain mean Room in some Disorder with old and worn out Furniture. Upon the
grand Stair-case there's another Picture representing the <i>Annunciation</i>
in like manner, which is done by <i>Titian</i>, and is not one of the worst of
his Performances. The upper Rooms are adorn'd with several Pictures done
by <i>Tintoret</i>, in which he has described our Lord's Passion. Our Saviour
appearing before <i>Pilate</i> is an admirable Piece; 'tis really moving to see
the Modesty and
Serenity<!--445.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
of his Countenance. A second Picture represents
our Lord carrying his Cross. In a third, we see him fasten'd on it, and
expiring for the Salvation of Mankind. These are invaluable Pieces, and
are reckon'd the compleatest that ever <i>Tintoret</i> painted.</p>

<p>I have also been to see the chief Palaces, which lie for the most part on
the great Canal, and that call'd <i>Reggio</i>. They are very magnificent, but
they are generally so like one another that he who has seen one may say he
has seen them all. They have little Court-Yards, less Gardens, and no
Stables. Nothing goes to form a Palace at <i>Venice</i> but the main Body of
the Building, a great Salon in the middle, and Apartments on the Right and
Left; and setting aside the Marble, there are Palaces as magnificent
elsewhere which have only the name of a House.</p>

<p>The Square of St. <i>Mark</i> is the ordinary Rendezvous of all the Gentry at
<i>Venice</i>. There are Nobles who keep their constant Circuits here as it
were, and who never stir from the Place but to Bed, for they pass their
whole Time in Gaming at the Coffee-Houses, or in the Peruke-Makers Shops.
The number of their Nobles is not limited; and any body for paying down
100000 Ducats may purchase Nobility. These Gentlemen compliment each other
with the Title of <i>Excellency</i>, and 'tis what they all challenge from
Foreigners. Mean time, some of those <i>Excellencies</i> go to the Shambles,
and to the Fish-Market, and carry home their Meat or their Fish under
their Robes, and some are so very poor that they go a begging. This Title
is so very common here that I had much ado to hinder a Lackey whom I hired
from giving it to me. Tho' I told him that I was by no means <i>Excellent</i>,
he made me answer that he knew full well what Obligations were due to my
Excellency, and that he would not be thought to be wanting in Respect to
my Excellency.
A<!--446.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
<i>Frenchman</i> lately come from <i>Constantinople</i> to whom I
made my Complaints, how much this Title was prophan'd, assur'd me that the
<i>Venetians</i> were still more lavish of it out of <i>Venice</i>, so that he heard
the very Grooms belonging to the Baillo of the Republic at
<i>Constantinople</i>, compliment one another with the Title of <i>Excellency</i>.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Venetian</i> Excellencies there are also <i>Petits-Maitres</i> who are
known by their Doublets lin'd with Scarlet, their fine white Perukes, by
their fantastical Step, and that Air of lolling which they give themselves
in their Gondola's, which are much smaller and nimbler than the common
sort. These <i>Petits-Maitres</i> are great Beaus, and have commonly more than
one Mistress at a time, and indeed there are few Nobles but have one at
least. These Creatures, excepting the little Liberty they enjoy, are as
happy as Sultana's. Their Lovers treat them like Princesses, and the
<i>Venetians</i> in general pay great respect to the whole Sex. I have seen
<i>Faustina</i> the famous Singer, and <i>Stringuetta</i> the noted Courtezan come
mask'd upon the Square of St. <i>Mark</i>, leaning on the Shoulders of
Noblemen, and every Man paying them as much Obeisance as if they had been
Ladies of great Importance. The same day that they appear'd on the Square
there happen'd to be a Skirmish between two Women mask'd that were Rivals,
who, as soon as they knew one another, fell out, went to Cuffs, tore off
each other's Masks, and at last Knives were drawn, with which they cut one
another so deeply that one of 'em was left dead on the Spot.</p>

<p>I now think it high time to finish my Letter which is already very long,
and perhaps too full of Trifles. I have told you every Thing that came
uppermost in my Mind, so that you have a

<h2>LETTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="center">
<span style="float: left"><i>SIR</i>,</span><span style="float: right"><i>Ronciglione, May 30, 1730.</i></span>
<span style="clear: none;">&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>As it appears by all the Letters from <i>Rome</i> that they are on the point of
chusing a new Pope, I set out sooner from <i>Venice</i> than I should otherways
have done, and came post to this City without stopping much by the Way. I
pass'd thro' <span class="smcap">Padua</span>, where I had the Honour to pay my Respects to the
Prince <i>Emanuel</i> of <i>Portugal</i>, who is come to reside there for some time,
and I was afterwards at the Comedy, which was indeed, a most wretched
Performance, but the Assembly was gay and numerous: Among the rest there
were a great number of Students and young Fellows, particularly one that
made a very finical Appearance, who had ten or twelve Patches on his Face,
a red Coat embroider'd with black Gawse, a Hat, a Shoulder-Knot,
Stockings, <i>&amp;c.</i> the whole trimm'd with Gawse. I took him at first for a
Mountebank, but I plainly saw that the Whimsicalness of his Dress was the
Humour of the Country. What gave me some Amusement was, to see a Hare
which Harlequin had taught to play Tricks, to tumble Top over Tail, to
leap over a Stick, and to beat a Drum with his two Fore-feet.</p>

<!--448.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>

<p>From <i>Padua</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Ferrara</span> a City in the Ecclesiastical State, where
the Pope keeps a Legat who is always a Cardinal. It appear'd to me to be a
large City with spacious Streets, and some fine Palaces, but it did not
seem to be very populous, which is ascrib'd to the bad Air in this
Country, otherwise one of the finest in all <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<p>The Road from <i>Ferrara</i> to <span class="smcap">Bologna</span> is extremely level, and as good and
agreeable in Summer as 'tis unpassable in Winter. <i>Bologna</i> is the second
City in the Ecclesiastical State, and is a large fine Town. 'Tis in a most
charming Situation, all the Country round it being properly a Garden, and
one of the most fruitful and fairest Plats in Nature. 'Tis said this City
contains near 80000 Inhabitants. The common People are civil and well
bred, and none more polite to Foreigners than the Noblemen. There are
stately Palaces here, of which I will only mention that of the Marquis
<i>Rinucci</i>, because to me it seem'd to be one of the most considerable in
the City. 'Tis very magnificent, and of a vast extent. The Ground-Floor
contains three large Apartments, the first Story five, and the second as
many. The Stair-case of this Palace is very much esteem'd for its
Contrivance. In one of the Halls are two large Pictures: The first is the
Consecration of the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. perform'd by the Pope at
<i>Bologna</i>: The second represents <i>Frederic</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i> giving
Audience to the Senate of <i>Bologna</i>: and their complimenting him on his
Arrival. In another of those Halls are two other curious large Pictures;
the one of Cardinal <i>Rinucci</i>, having Audience of the King of <i>Poland</i>
when he was sent to him as Nuncio; and the second shews the same Cardinal
receiving the Cap from <i>Lewis</i> XIV. King of <i>France</i>, at whose Court he
was Nuncio when he was promoted to the Purple. The Apartments adjoining to
these Halls are
also<!--449.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
adorn'd with excellent Paintings and very richly
furnish'd.</p>

<p>The Churches of <i>Bologna</i> are not less magnificent than the finest
Churches in <i>Italy</i>. I thought that of St. <i>Paul</i> the most worthy of
Remark, which is serv'd by <i>Bernardine</i> Fryars. The Roof is adorn'd with
Paintings representing the History of St. <i>Paul</i>. These Pictures which are
highly esteem'd are the Performances of <i>Antonio Caccioli</i> and <i>Rolli</i> two
Natives of <i>Bologna</i>, and they have both out-done themselves. The Painting
of the Dome where St. <i>Paul</i> is represented on his Knees ready to have his
Head struck off is admirably fine. The high Altar is of Marble of various
Colours, finish'd with a great deal of Art. The Seats of the Monks are of
Wallnut-Tree, and over them are several Pictures of the Life of St. <i>Paul</i>
drawn by an able Hand, who was <i>Carache</i>'s Pupil. The Churches of St.
<i>Catherine</i> of <i>Bologna</i>, and St. <i>Michael</i> in <i>Bosco</i> are well worth the
Traveller's Observation, on account of the choice Pictures with which they
are adorn'd. St. <i>Michael</i>'s in <i>Bosco</i> stands upon an Eminence three
Miles from <i>Bologna</i>, to which there's an Entrance thro' a cover'd Gallery
made like a Piazza. 'Twas a Work erected by the Citizens of <i>Bologna</i>, out
of their Devotion to a miraculous Image of the <i>Holy Virgin</i> which is
reverenc'd in this Church.</p>

<p>The Legate's Palace is very ancient, but grand and magnificent. 'Tis as
strictly guarded during the Vacancy of the Holy See as if the Enemy were
at the Gates of the City. All the Avenues to it are hung with Chains: The
<i>Swiss</i> Guards are arm'd with Cuirasses: The Guard which consists of fifty
Soldiers is barricaded with Pallisades and Chevaux de Frise, and the
Palace-Gate is defended by eight Pieces of Cannon.</p>

<!--450.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p>What remains for me to tell you of <i>Bologna</i> is, that 'tis one of the
Cities in <i>Italy</i> where a Foreigner finds most Amusement. The Nobility not
only strive to give him Pleasure, but he has fine Paintings to feast his
Eye, and here are often excellent Concerts of Music, Operas, and Comedies,
charming Walks, and genteel Country-Houses; which I take to be all that
can be desir'd in Life.</p>

<p>From <i>Bologna</i> I travell'd in two days to <i>Florence</i>, after having been
dragg'd in my Chaise thro' the <i>Apennines</i>, a prodigious Range of
Mountains; which is a thing I shall never do again while I live; for I
really suffer'd very much in this Road, and if ever you should have a
fancy to come this way, I would advise you to carry Provisions or a Cook
with you, for there is not one considerable Place in all the Road.
<i>Fiorenzola</i>, which is almost half way, is a sorry little Town. From
thence to <i>Scarperia</i> the Road is extremely rugged. One descends a high
Mountain pav'd like a Stair-case, which to attempt in a Chaise, you are
sure of being, if I may so call it, broke upon the Wheel, and therefore I
chose to walk down. At <i>Scarperia</i> the Road becomes more passable, and it
mends as you come near <i>Florence</i>. In our Way we pass'd thro' a Town
call'd <i>Ponte</i> that stands at the Foot of a Hill, where the Great Duke has
a Castle which appear'd to me to be very well fortify'd.</p>

<p>One perceives <span class="smcap">Florence</span> a great way off, and indeed it makes a fine point
of View to see so great a City in a beautiful Valley between Hills which
rise insensibly, and end at length in high Mountains, inhabited in such a
manner that they may be reckon'd the Suburbs of <i>Florence</i>. The River
<i>Arno</i> passes thro' both the City and the Valley. Among all the Cities of
<i>Italy</i>, <i>Florence</i> may justly be surnamed the <i>Fair</i>, since it has all
that can be desir'd in a great and wealthy Town, such as sacred and
profane
Edifices,<!--451.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Bridges, Monuments, and Fountains; yet 'tis not so
large nor populous as <i>Bologna</i>. As I enter'd <i>Florence</i> I perceived over
the Gate a Table of white Marble with a <i>Latin</i> Inscription on it, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Florentia, Adventu Friderici IV.
Daniæ et Norvegiæ, Augusti, Felicis, quod eam sua Præsentia magnus Hospes
impleverit, Augusta felix, An. S. 1708. Mense Martio.</span></div>

<p>'Twas the late Great Duke <i>Cosmo</i> who caus'd this to be engrav'd to the
Honour of the King of <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Florence</i> has been so well describ'd that I shall pass very
briefly over all that relates to the Buildings. The Square call'd <i>Piazza
del Gran Duca</i> or the old Palace, contains Ornaments enough to embellish a
great Town. Here you see a spacious Fountain which <i>Cosmo</i> I. caus'd to be
built after the Designs of <i>Amminati</i> and <i>Philip Baldinucci</i>, two of the
most famous Sculptors at that Time. Not far from this Fountain is the
Equestrian Statue of <i>Cosmo</i> I. which is rais'd upon a great Pedestal of
white Marble, with this Inscription engrav'd on the chief Front of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Cosmo Medici, Magno Etruriæ Duci Primo,
Pio, Felici, Invicto, Justo, Clementi, Sacræ Militiæ Pacisque in Etruria
Authori, Patri et Principi Optimo, Ferdinandus F. Mag. Dux III. erexit,
An.ci</span>&#0596;<span class="smcap"> i</span>&#0596; <span class="smcap">lxxxxiiii.</span></div>

<p>On the other three Sides of the Pedestal are very fine Bas-Reliefs of
Brass. The first represents <i>Cosmo</i> I. recogniz'd for Sovereign by the
Senate
of<!--452.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
<i>Florence</i>; the second the Ceremony of <i>Cosmo</i>'s Coronation,
and the third the same <i>Cosmo</i> in an antique triumphant Car making his
pompous Entry into <i>Sienna</i>, which was submitted to his Government.
<i>Ferdinand</i> I. <i>de Medicis</i> when he erected this Statue to the Honour of
his Father, employ'd in the Direction of it the famous <i>John Bologna</i>, who
has very well answer'd the Opinion that had been conceiv'd of him.</p>

<p>In the Great Duke's Gallery near the Square, I saw the greatest
Curiosities, both among the Antients and Moderns. A Busto of <i>Alexander</i>
the Great, the famous Statue of <i>Venus</i>, cut by <i>Apollodorus</i>, with those
of the Emperors and Empresses of <i>Rome</i>, and the greatest Personages of
former Centuries; the best Originals of the greatest Painters; and a
thousand uncommon things, such as Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, Emeralds,
Saphirs, Topazes, Amber, Porcellain, Crystal, Porphyry, Coral, Marble, and
Granite, the Particulars of which wou'd form a Volume. They are actually
engraving on Plates, and several Persons of Quality are contributing to
the Expence of this fine Work, which is considerable, and for which
excellent Designers are employ'd. This wou'd have been worthy of the Great
Duke, and it seems to me that this Prince when he sees his Family extinct,
and his Estate pass into the hands of Foreigners, ought at least to
eternize the Glory of his Ancestors by publishing an Inventory of the
immense Wealth which they have acquired, and transmitted to their
Posterity.</p>

<p>Of all the Churches in <i>Italy</i> there are none more magnificent as to the
outside than the Dome of <i>Milan</i>, and the Cathedral of <i>Florence</i>, both
which are entirely lin'd with Marble of various Colours. A Citizen of
<i>Florence</i>, who pretended to know the History of this City perfectly well,
assur'd me that its Cathedral was built out of the Impost
of<!--453.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
five <i>Sous</i>
which had been laid upon every Piece of Cloth that was then sold at
<i>Florence</i>; but I believe you may without Breach of Charity take this for
a Story.</p>

<p>Over against the Cathedral is the magnificent Baptistery, to which there's
an Entrance thro' three Gates of Brass, so artfully wrought that <i>Michael
Angelo</i> said they were good enough to be the Gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>St. <i>Laurence</i>'s Chapel, which is not yet finish'd, is the Admiration of
all Connoisseurs, and is design'd to be the Place for the Burial of the
Great Dukes, whose Remains are to be deposited in a Mausoleum of wonderful
Workmanship, adorn'd with precious Stones. 'Tis 150 years ago that this
Chapel has been building, and yet it wants two Thirds of being finish'd.
If it were lawful to criticise the Conduct of Princes, I must say it
again, that the Great Duke, who sees that his Greatness and his Family
must end with him, ought to put the last hand to this Monument of the
Magnificence of the <i>Medicis</i>: For can he hope, that if he himself
neglects to transmit the Lustre of his Family to Posterity, his Successors
will think to do it, who are nothing to him, or at least but very little?
But such is the Humour of <i>John Gaston</i> Great Duke of <i>Tuscany</i>; he is so
indifferent and unconcern'd about every thing, that he sees Foreigners
dispose of his Dominions, and nominate his Successor, and the Courtiers
ready to abandon him and to worship the said Successor; and yet the
Prospect, how disagreeable soever it may be, does not seem to give him any
Uneasiness: And he said some days ago, after he had sign'd his Last Will
and Testament, declaring <i>Don Carlos</i> Infante of <i>Spain</i> his Successor,
<i>that he had just got a Son and Heir by a Dash of his Pen, which he had
not been able to get in thirty four years Marriage</i>.</p>

<!--454.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, Sir, I have given all you will have of me this time touching
<i>Florence</i>, where I cou'd stay but a few days, and then made no
Acquaintance, having only been taken up in seeing the Curiosities of this
City. At my Return from <i>Rome</i> I propose to come hither again, and make
some stay in order to get a little Knowledge of the Court; and then you
shall be inform'd of every Remark that I make.</p>

<p>From <i>Florence</i> I went and din'd at <i>Castilloncello</i>, and lay at <span class="smcap">Sienna</span> a
City in the Duchy of <i>Tuscany</i>, to which <i>Cosmo</i> I. <i>de Medicis</i> made it
subject, not without great Resistance from the <i>Siennois</i>. The City which
is both an Archbishoprick and an University, is very pleasantly situate,
and enjoys a very good Air. 'Tis said that <i>Italian</i> is spoke here with
more Purity than in any other Town in <i>Italy</i>. It seem'd to me to want
Inhabitants, for I went thro' several Streets and did not meet a Soul.
'Tis said that a great many of the Nobility are settled in <i>Sienna</i>, and
that Strangers are sure to meet with a civil Reception here, but as I
staid no more than one day, I had only a cursory View of the Town. The
Cathedral appear'd to me to be a great and noble Building lin'd with
Marble. The Great Duke's Palace is ancient, but commodious. It has a Tower
which is look'd upon as a singular piece of Architecture. The Great
Princess<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> <i>Violante</i> of <i>Bavaria</i> is Governess of <i>Sienna</i>. She liv'd
formerly in this City, and was mightily belov'd in it; but she has resided
for some time at <i>Florence</i>. The Square which is before the Palace is
oval, and hollow in the Middle, so that it may be laid under-water like
the Square <i>Navona</i> at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Sienna</i> to <i>Viterbo</i> the Road is extremely bad, I passed the
Mountain of <i>Radifocani</i>, situate in one of the vilest Countries in all
<i>Italy</i>. At the top of the Mountain there's a Castle, where a
Garison<!--455.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
of
fifteen Men is kept, with a Commanding Officer, whom I found at the House
of Entertainment where I alighted. He had been a Lieutenant in <i>France</i> in
the Royal <i>Italian</i> Regiment, and spoke very good <i>French</i>. He told me
that the Inhabitants under his Government were as bad as the Country, of
which some Moments after, I saw a Proof. A Mule-driver having a Quarrel
with the Drawer, the latter stabb'd him with a Knife in the Rim of the
Belly, with as much Sedateness as if he had been doing a good Action; and
the Commandant never caus'd the Assassin to be apprehended: for which when
I express'd my Surprize to him, he said he had nothing to do out of his
Place; and that besides he did not dare to cause the Assassin to be
apprehended, because he had three Brothers as wicked as himself, who wou'd
not fail to take a Revenge if he was punish'd. And then, said he, I shou'd
have enough to do if I were to cause all to be apprehended who give Wounds
with Knives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aquapendente</span> is a sorry little Town, and yet a Metropolis. <span class="smcap">Bolsena</span> is no
better, and <span class="smcap">Montefiascone</span> tho' a Bishoprick, wou'd not be worth
mentioning, were it not for its Vineyards which produce excellent
<i>Muscadine</i> Wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viterbo</span>, three Leagues from <i>Montefiascone</i>, seem'd to me to be a pretty
Town. 'Tis adorn'd with three fine Fountains, and pav'd with great Flint
Stones which are four foot long and two foot broad. This City has some
fine Houses in it. 'Tis the See of a Bishop, and its Cathedral is a
Structure which does not want for Grandeur. In this Church the Archbishop
and Elector of <i>Cologn</i> was consecrated by Pope <i>Benedict</i> XIII. who came
hither on purpose to save the Elector all manner of dispute about
Precedency with the Cardinals; who were in their turn so disgruntled with
the Pope, that none of them accompany'd him in this Journey.</p>

<!--456.png--><p><span class="pagenum">431</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monteroso</span> is a pretty Town, but <span class="smcap">Ronciglione</span> outdoes it; and indeed in all
the Ecclesiastical State there is not a pleasanter. It drives a great
Trade in Snuff. I came hither yesterday at Noon, and don't think of going
away 'till this Evening, my Chaise being broke. I hope however to lie this
Night at <i>Rome</i>, from whence I purpose to send you many good Stories
forthwith. You will do me a Pleasure to let me hear from you; and to
believe me in <i>Italy</i>, as well as elsewhere, yours, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

Estate. The Catastrophe of this Gentleman is so tragical an Incident, that
it will be proper to give a short but true History of it, as it is related
in the following Circular Letter, wrote by the King of <i>Poland</i>'s Order,
to his Ministers abroad, for the Information of all the Foreign Courts.
The Letter was dated at <i>Warsaw</i>, the 12th of <i>May</i>, O. S. 1736, as
follows.</p>

<div>
<span class="smcap">Sir,</span>
</div>

<p>'The tragical Death of the Count <i>de Hoym</i> having been variously reported
both in printed Papers and written Letters, and with Circumstances not
strictly true; the King has order'd me to give you an exact Information of
this Affair.
</p>

<p>'You will remember what the late King, of glorious Memory, signified to
his Ministers abroad, concerning the Reasons and Circumstances that
preceded, accompanied, and followed the Disgrace of the Count <i>de Hoym</i>.
</p>

<p>'This Count having been a second time arrested for other Crimes, after the
Death of the late King, was committed in 1733, to <i>Sonnenstein</i>, from
whence the present King was so merciful as to release him some Weeks
after; contenting himself to bind him again by Oaths stronger than the
former; whereby the Count obliged himself to continue quiet at his Estate,
without concerning himself with any but his own private Affairs.
</p>

<p>'Yet towards the close of the Year 1734, and at the time when the King was
in <i>Poland</i>, the Count, notwithstanding his Engagements, took the
Opportunity of his Majesty's Absence, to set on foot other Intrigues, in
defiance of his Oaths and his Promises; whereof the King being timely
inform'd, order'd him to be arrested and committed Prisoner to
<i>Konigstein</i>; which was the reason of his attempting his Life by a Pistol,
whereof I acquainted you by my Circular Letter of the 15th of <i>January</i>,
1735.
</p>

<p>'An Information was afterwards preparing for the Trial of him and his
Accomplices; but not many days after the first Examination, the said Count
being stung by the Remorse of his Conscience, and vexed to see all his
Pranks laid open, chose to shorten the Course of Justice by putting an end
to his own Life, notwithstanding the undeniable Proofs he had before
experienc'd of his Majesty's Clemency. For this purpose he first pretended
to be sick, and having order'd his Domestics not to disturb him, he hang'd
himself the 21st of <i>April</i> last, at Night, with a Handkerchief ty'd to a
Hook that supported his Looking-glass. The Letter he wrote to his
Domestics with a Pencil, and which was found upon the Floor, is an
indisputable Mark of the deliberate Purpose and cold Blood with which he
executed this Design. Moreover, in searching his Pockets a Razor was found
on him, with a Penknife, Scissars, and the like Instruments.
</p>

<p>The Family of the Deceas'd having petition'd the King not to proceed
against the Corpse with the Severity of the Law, his Majesty has been so
good as to order the Body of the Self-murderer to be privately interr'd,
just without the Church-Yard of the Garrison at the Fort of <i>Konigstein</i>.'
</p>

<div class="right">
<i>I am</i>, &amp;c.
</div>

<p>The Night before the Count dispatch'd himself, he left a Note upon his
Table for his two Servants, as follows:
</p>

<p>'Be prudent, make no Noise or Alarm, untie me immediately, put me to Bed,
and then shut the Door after you, by bolting it when you are out, which
you may do by the help of this Pack-thread; and by this means no body will
know you have been in my Chamber. The World will doubtless believe I died
of an Apoplexy; if you perform my Orders discreetly and faithfully, my
Family will pay you 1000 Ducats, on sight of this Note.'</p></div>

has a longer Leaf. The Roots fatten and improve barren Ground exceedingly,

containing the Abridgments of the Lives of the Emperors of the <i>West</i>, and
of the <i>East</i>, their Pictures and Medals, and those of their Families, the
whole collected in 1550, by <i>James de Strada</i> of <i>Mantua</i>. The Medals are
very well design'd, and <i>Occo</i> the famous Antiquary affirms in a Letter
quoted by M. <i>Patin</i>, that every Figure on them cost a Crown the
engraving. There is a particular MS. which contains a Collection of Tracts
by certain <i>Greek</i> Chymists concerning the desirable <i>Art of making Gold</i>.

O. S. died on the 10th of <i>April</i> 1736, O. S. so suddenly, that when his
Gentleman went that Morning, as usual, into his Chamber to awake him, he
was found dead in his Bed. He had been the day before very gay with
Company whom he entertain'd at Dinner, and made not the least Complaint of
any Ailment, tho' he had for some time before been so indispos'd that he
did not venture abroad. 'Tis supposed that he was choak'd by an immoderate
Defluxion of Rheum with which he was now and then troubled. His sudden
Death cast the City and Court of <i>Vienna</i> into such a Consternation as did
prodigious Honour to his immortal Memory. On the 15th, after having lain
three days in State, he was interr'd in the Tomb of his Nephew <i>Emanuel</i>
Prince of <i>Savoy</i> (which the Princess of <i>Savoy</i> Countess of <i>Soissons</i>
caus'd to be erected in the Metropolitan Church of St. <i>Stephen</i>) with all
the Military Honours, and all the Magnificence due to his illustrious
Birth, and to these important Services which he perform'd to the August
House of <i>Austria</i> during the Reigns of three successive Emperors. A Will
was found among his Papers, whereby he declar'd the late Prince <i>Eugene</i>
of <i>Savoy</i> his Nephew who died the year before at <i>Manheim</i> his universal
Heir. But after that time a Codicil was made, tho' never sign'd by Prince
<i>Eugene</i>, declaring for his Heir his Niece <i>Louisa de Seissons</i> of
<i>Carignan</i> (who was born <i>December</i> 16, 1686.) then at a <i>Nunnery</i> in
<i>France</i>. The Prince left behind him a numerous and curious library of
Books, many of which he bought when at <i>London</i> of <i>Christopher Bateman</i>
in <i>Pater-noster Row</i>, besides a fine Cabinet of Medals and other
Curiosities. The Emperor has bought his Library of his Niece for 20000
Florins.

<p>Since the Prince's Death the Count <i>de Konigseg</i>, Vice-President of the
Council of War, has the chief Direction of Military Affairs at this Court,
and signs all Dispatches and Commissions which that Prince sign'd as first
President of the said Council, for thirty-three years. His Regiment of

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
